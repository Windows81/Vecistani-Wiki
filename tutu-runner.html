	</aside> Tutu Runner was a main belligerent in the <a href="war-of-chickish.html" title="The Great War of Çıkış">War of Çıkış</a>. He has a reported IQ of 250 despite having had been born in a universe where the vast majority of people have an IQ below 70. Following his withdrawal from the war in late 2019, not much is known about his whereabouts, aside from a few choice interviews on anti-Vecistani news shows.

	<h2 id="Early-Life">Early Life</h2>
	<p>
		Tutu Runner was born on 31st June 1987 in the Stupid Universe under the name 'Tutu Guy'. At his first day of school, he was bullied for his appearance. In an interview with prominent anti-Vecistani newspaper <i>The Veggie-stani</i>, he stated that the bullying stopped immediately when he flaunted his flying skills at such a young age.
	</p>

		In July 2019, VisualPlugin reportedly travelled back in time to 24th December 2000 and ensnared Tutu Runner into transforming into a gingerbread man, draining him of his superior intellect. This spell was undone after almost 17 years when one of VisualPlugin's allies <a href="https://youtu.be/0DSOpZvUsZQ?t=363">attempted to trap his soul in an echo-chamber</a> before being released and retransformed by <span class="new" title="The Belluminati (page does not exist)" data-uncrawlable-url="aHR0cHM6Ly92ZWNpc3Rhbi5mYW5kb20uY29tL3dpa2kvVGhlX0JlbGx1bWluYXRpP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==">The Belluminati</span>. The incident, though not documented in Vecistani videology, triggered a chain reaction that eventually caused him to get his original likeness back. Following the incident, Tutu Runner was said to be 'hell-bent on defeating VisualPlugin once and for all'.

		It is speculated that Tutu Runner was cognisant of VisualPlugin's intentions shortly prior to his transformation in 2000.

	<h2 id="Relationship-with-VisualPlugin">Relationship with VisualPlugin</h2>
	<p>
		Contrary to popular Vecistani belief, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3IVm-bvxkg&amp;list=PLO5PZUR0wDLA4mEw1mqLVG7eYDwONiwoS&amp;index=48">VisualPlugin first met Tutu Runner on friendly terms</a> - to discuss transferring VisualPlugin's soul to a new body whilst keeping the previous one intact. They reached an agreement that sometime in the future, Tutu Runner would initiate a ransomware attack on VisualPlugin's computer, giving him a vector for which to control the Plugin's mind. Despite this encounter being VisualPlugin's first time meeting Tutu Runner, the inverse is not true; Tutu Runner first met VisualPlugin in 2000.
	</p>
	<h2 id="End-of-War">End of War</h2>
	<p>
	<p>
		The official end to the War of Çıkış was marked by Tutu Runner's withdrawal from conflict in late 2019 after VisualPlugin reportedly gave him a life <i>grounding</i> sentence (i.e., solitary confinement). After his escape, Tutu Runner chose to stop fighting with VisualPlugin since he recognised that 'the war would have no end if I kept fighting with VisualPlugin, irrespective of how much of the time I win or lose'.
	</p>
	</p>
	As of 2022-03-21, Vecistan is deliberately not investigating the whereabouts of Tutu Runner. This is to maintain the narrative that the war was decisively won, and therefore ensure morale in Vecistan remains high.
