	<h1>Vecistani Calendar</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			In the same way Turkmenistan had done under Naziyov's reign</a>, Vecistan has its own month/day-of-week system. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche_calendar#:~:text=The%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea%20calendar%2C%20DPRK,system%20of%20year-numbering%20used%20in%20the%20North%20Korea.">North-Korean-inspired year-naming system</a> is also adopted for use in Vecistan. Note that year ranges do not begin or end on the beginning of a new year. The partial year in which a Vecistani era begins is numbered 0. The year number then increments by one on 1st January. I.e., <i>31st Wrappersmonth of Mərhəmətli 1</i> (2019-12-31) comes before <i>1st Victorysmonth of Mərhəmətli 2</i> (2020-01-01).
