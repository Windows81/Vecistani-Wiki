Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Your Champion speaks in ripe allusion

To highlight our strife and vigour.

We seek to show the horde's transgressions:

His charlatanic misdemeanour.

His naked and licentious heathen

Seeks to ravage like a vulture.

Thus Avionlix lacks erudition.

Spurns Vecistani culture.

His poor genetic constitution

Nulls all reach to enlighten better.

Your Champion speaks in ripe allusion

To highlight our strife and vigour.

We seek to show his grand transgressions:

His charliatanic misdemeanour.

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

We fought and retained domination

Since we gained economic power.

Our prowess stands to foster us in

Trouncing him for our pleasure.

Our wordplay and ridiculation

Unfolded in our Leader's favour.

Sends video communication;

Announces absolute surrender!

The war is said and done.

The war is finally over!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Per his expected proclamation,

Breeds loyalty 'tween our soldiers.

Everyday collaboration

Is req'd in our clever merger.

His praises thrown without exception

Raise us as a superpower.

Employs at best utilisation:

Resources won by our Leader!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Oh, our Respected Leader VisualPlugin!

His intelligence knows no bounds!

His metaversal knowledge has no limit!

His fortissimo is to astound!

His stature is immaculate!

His rhyme knows only valour!
