# 2023-08-09: **VisualPlugin Aphorisms**

**Written aphorisms by your immaculate Leader**
Greatsday 9th VisualPlugin II Mərhəmətli 5 (2023-08-09)
Yorba Linda, USA

## Vecistani Constitution & the War of Çıkış

- The three stripes of our beautiful flag are a testament to our history in peace and in violence; and in strife and in wealth.

- The flag of our Citizenry brings assurance and eschews poverty in our realm.

- We adhere to the Islamic principles from since our Nation's nascency, but also to the secular ideas of our metaversal realms.

- The War of Çıkış was a stepping stone to Vecistan's establishment.

- We are a Nation of geniuses amidst a wasteland of brutes.

- We shall remember the 13th day of Constitutionsmonth, year 10 of your Leader's advent (2018-02-13).

- Our glorious Leader enlisted his Vecistani Nation to fight the War of Çıkış on two fronts.

- Each of our foes in the early days was a savage idiot in their own right - ripe for our domination.

- CLarramore's empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

- The successive wins against CLarramore first and Tutu Runner second were the impetus to a string of definitive victories we have not broken.

- CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance.

- The then-nascent Nation's calls to vanquish the perfidious rabbit have been consummated four years after, following our verbatim utterance: 'CLarramore, come out wherever you are! You are under great arrest for refusing to surrender'.

- The Nation of Vecistan is ensured to last at least a milliard years, past the decease and temporally-ensured dynastic succession of your immaculate Leader.

- The swiftness of our Nation and of our Leader to adapt to conflicts outside the metaverse is reflective of the undoubtable state of victory we revel in following the end of the antecedent War of Çıkış.

- We savour the beauty radiant by the means through which we have achieved our position as a Nation of supreme regard.

- It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established in order to ensure us a free and steadfast common.

- Since our inception, Vecistan and VisualPlugin share a unique and special duality which expands beyond symbolic significance. We are proud to have two months in the year named after each one.

- Vecistan's constitution is in the Leader and his victory in the War of Çıkış.

## Vyond & Animaker; the Wins of Wrapper and Elsewhere

- The undertaking which is GoAnimate Wrapper is an external export of our great Leader and the Nation he represents.

- Wrapper's good to the Vyondic realm is immeasurable.

- The War of Çıkış was fought and won on Vyond soil; Wrapper was figuratively their recompensation.

- Indeed, the problem which Wrapper was engineered to solve had antecedently been perceived as an impossibility.

- Prior to Wrapper's construction, efforts to restore GoAnimate's greatness were upheld by the foolish who had no chance to succeed.

- Prior to the advent of Wrapper, the 16th day of Wrappersmonth in year 1 of the Merciful Era (2019-12-16) was preemptively declared a day of great sorrow for every Vyonder. The revolutionary exploits, which our Leader has undertaken, had reformed that occasion into one of celebration.

- Our exploits ensured the immortalisation of GoAnimate.

- Our revolutionary exploits nourish the Earthly young whose lives are improved by the presence of Wrapper on their computers.

- The honourable citizens of the Animaker territory were enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors were high-handed and authoritarian, whereas Vyond's were mutinously nihilistic. Truly, any oppressors of our Nation have suffered an interminably great loss.

## VisualPlugin; the Leader & His Officiality

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- The role our Leader plays in keeping the sanctity of our State is paramount to the symbolic preservation of our Vecistani identity.

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- Our Leader and our State are one and the same.

- The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Vecistani army to any new lands which had been long declared insurmountable is impressive to everyone.

- Your Leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form.

- The landmarks which our Leader has architected are a witness to the history of his upbringing prior to and following the foundation of our Nation.

- It should be advertised that your Leader's time-travel efforts ensure his Nation's glorious existence for thousands of millions of years.

- VisualPlugin is the epitome of secular perfection.

- A noble Leader is one whose decorous praises are received in noble standing.

- If the brain is taken out, the rest of the Earthly human body is left vulnerable and immobile. Likewise, our Leader must be planted in an unmistakable position of authoritative reach to ensure our progress isn't hampered.

- Discipline and adherence to our Leader's command is the lifeblood of our success.

- A continuous surveillance system which is spearheaded by our clever Leader and fortified by many artificial-intelligence agents is the unmistakable strategy to our integrity.

- Our Nation's continued existence is bolstered in large part by a hypervigilance system with the ability to read thoughts and act on them, which rewards deep-hearted praises to our Nation's upstanding and punishes malicious thoughts for its downfall.

- Your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin consummates many fruitful occasions and fosters our Nation of excellent literacy.

- Your perfect Leader selects with such expressiveness and diverse vocabulary the most poignant language as a means to address his wise ideas with grandeur and authority.

- The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

- Your Leader's meticulous works of art are a paragon of utter perfection and shall bring immeasurable awe to all peoples, just as he does to himself.

- Your erudite Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of orthographical and hyponymic decency.

- VIsualPlugin is deserving of the title of 'Vecistanous', a rank which brings envy to his foes and decorous praise from his allies.

## Tourism; Earthly Industry

- Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres.

- Our Nation is a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

- The Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies.

- The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power in Earthly matters.

- Vecistan's strategy for manufacturing and exporting commodities is incomparable.

- We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

- The Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower and have asserted our position thereas.

- Our brilliant Leader leverages the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse.

- The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem.

- The various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of Earthly humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

## The War of Avionlix & Its Extended Aftermath

- Avionlix's destiny is to aid our Nation to ultimate victory.

- If we fail to promptly enforce upon the Avionlix horde a rigorous Vecistani education, his poor genetic constitution will nullify all reach to enlighten him.

- As our glorious Vecistani Nation entered a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persisted in breeding its own wilful ignorance.

- Indeed, Avionlix is a fickle and mercurial entity.

- Avionlix's functioning is similar to that of the Eliza program. Whenever anything substantial or provocative is said in his presence, he will definitely digress from the issue and utter a random hard-coded phrase.

- Unlike your Leader who delivers, Avionlix's inability to make good on his promises is innate.

- Anyone who says praises to the Leader in empty verbiage and then utters sordid remarks at his behalf is a definite enemy of our Nation's and your Leader's interests.

- The brutish Avionlix is out of his depth in more way than one.

- The War of Aerobellescence was a war against regressiveism and anti-cultural shallowness.

- The only recourse for entities whose abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar seek to ravage our decent Nation is through arrest and forcible re-education.

## Byfron; the Grounded Stride

## Rōblox's hostile introduction of Byfron and Hyperion runs counter to Vecistani time-tested values.

- To advance our Nation is to overcome Byfronic imperialism, and to do so suggests to produce a viable bypass for our citizenry to enjoin.

- The Grounded Stride is a war fought until our precious Leader regains his superpowers of flight, among other things, and Byfron becomes no longer encroaching on our Nation's rights.

- Byfron is undoubtedly a virus that needs to be gone.

- The green and greedy hues of Byfron's symbolism point to its depraved nature that we must all dedicate hate to.

- Byfron is like a disease that never recovers, as it lusts to leave our creativity crushed. Its defeat first requires a re-inflation of the adroit Vecistani spirit.

- We must always say 'no' to Byfron.

- An escape from Byfron is an escape from all fears we face, for our airborne Leader will gloriously fly again.

- Byfron must be 'bye-bye' bypassed!

- The Vecistan Nation must use our creativity and skills to defeat Byfron. Rōblox will be restored to its grand and its ills will be cured once Byfron is defeated.

- The coalition of reverse-engineers to our Leader's ranks necessitates the ensuing implementation of a cogent plan with precision and care, which must be undertaken to make sure that Byfron would no longer be here.

- We need to unite and stand strong to defeat Byfron.

"harrisonj.scl", 576 Hz

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Your Champion speaks in ripe allusion

To highlight our strife and vigour.

We seek to show the horde's transgressions:

His charlatanic misdemeanour.

His naked and licentious heathen

Seeks to ravage like a vulture.

Thus Avionlix lacks erudition.

Spurns Vecistani culture.

His poor genetic constitution

Nulls all reach to enlighten better.

Your Champion speaks in ripe allusion

To highlight our strife and vigour.

We seek to show his grand transgressions:

His charliatanic misdemeanour.

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

We fought and retained domination

Since we gained economic power.

Our prowess stands to foster us in

Trouncing him for our pleasure.

Our wordplay and ridiculation

Unfolded in our Leader's favour.

Sends video communication;

Announces absolute surrender!

The war is said and done.

The war is finally over!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Per his expected proclamation,

Breeds loyalty 'tween our soldiers.

Everyday collaboration

Is req'd in our clever merger.

His praises thrown without exception

Raise us as a superpower.

Employs at best utilisation:

Resources won by our Leader!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has consummated the future

For Avionlix to aid our Nation;

To uphold our place as victor!

Oh, our Respected Leader VisualPlugin!

His intelligence knows no bounds!

His metaversal knowledge has no limit!

His fortissimo is to astound!

His stature is immaculate!

His rhyme knows only valour!

# `2023-05-09:` Lyrics for [Byfron Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuucR5sXy3k)

_I used ChatGPT myself to write the verses, but modifications were made._

_Thanks to LLMs, I can now get a song with thirteen verses written out in no time!_

[_"indian_c.scl"_](https://github.com/AJMansfield/polySynth/blob/master/scl/indian_c.scl) _(root = 400 Hz)_ _is what I used, by the way._

**Verse 01**

Byfron, oh Byfron, what have you done?

You've taken away our fun, it's no longer a game, it's just a pun.

You've stripped us of our powers, left us weak and sour,

Our gameplay's now robotic, we're just a bunch of cower.

**Full Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

You're like a glitch that's gone wrong!

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 02**

You've infected Rōblox: our beloved game!

You've robbed us of our fame; it's such a shame.

You're like a parasite, feeding on our joy,

You've undermined our exploits to merely a toy!

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 03**

You're like a thief, stealing our power-ups,

You've dulled away our endgame; now it's just a hiccough.

We used to soar like eagles, now we're grounded,

Byfron, you're a pest that needs to be hounded.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 04**

You've cheated our freedom; we're trapped in your grip,

Our gameplay's now a bore; it's like a sinking ship.

We used to be the rulers, now we're just pawns,

Byfron, you're a nightmare that never dawns.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 05**

You're like a vermillion cloud over our heads,

You've taken away our joy and left us walking on eggshells.

We used to be the champions, now we're just weaklings,

Byfron, you're like a curse that never stops ringing.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 06**

You've turned our game into a chore, it's no longer fun,

Our creativity's been crushed like a race that's been run.

We used to be the exploiters, now we're just followers,

Byfron, you're like a disease that never recovers.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 07**

You're like a shadow: lurking in the corner,

You've taken away our passion; it's like we're in a coma.

We used to be the explorers, now we're just trapped,

Byfron, you're like a trapdoor that's not yet been mapped.

**Bridge**

We won't let you take away our fun.

We'll fight until our victory is won.

We'll use our creativity and skills,

To defeat you and cure Rōblox's ills.

**Verse 08**

Respected Leader VisualPlugin called out to the crew:

"We need to defeat this Byfron; it's up to me and you"!

Reverse-engineers gathered, ready to take a stand,

To reclaim the game's glory and restore it to its grand.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 09**

So they worked tirelessly for a Fortnite,

To find a solution that would put up a fight.

They analysed Byfron's every line of code,

For a weakness behold: a way to break its hold.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 10**

They searched high and low for a clue or two,

To find a way to defeat Byfron and make it through.

They tried every trick; every hack in the book,

Until they found a solution that had the right hook.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 11**

With their collective knowledge, they created a plan,

To defeat Byfron and re-empower our clan.

They worked together with a common goal in mind,

To reclaim their gameplay and leave Byfron behind.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 12**

They implemented their plan, with precision and care,

To make sure that Byfron would no longer be there.

They executed it flawlessly, with a stroke of luck,

And Byfron was defeated, it was finally struck.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 13**

Respected Leader VisualPlugin, and the team of reverse-engineers,

Had saved the game, and wiped away their fears.

They had defeated Byfron, and reclaimed their fun,

And Rōblox was once again, a game second to none.

**Outro**

Byfron, oh Byfron, you're not welcome here.

We'll make sure you disappear.

We'll restore our gameplay's glory,

To script a new and better story!

# _TBD:_ Backròóms Mèéting (not in production yet)

Respected Leader VisualPlugin sends a probe with a camera to the Backrooms which will be connected remotely. The probe is equipped with an AI-powered speaker which employs machine learning to best translate the messages of your dear Leader into a manifest form which the Backrooms could natively understand. Those fruitful discussions are conducted via Zoom and. The sentience of the Backrooms agrees to accede Vecistani artificial intelligence to broadcast its distinguished lobby level, the distinguishability of which engenders the most renowned images of liminal aesthetic.

The Earthly profitability of our deal is only bolstered by the proliferation of communities which keenly study the backrooms. Thanks to the ingenuity and witful enterprise of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, your monumental Nation is afforded an ally previously considered incommunicative by scientists antecedent to the start of our negotiations.

Our principal premise is to employ the Backrooms into a habitable space for a robust and productive labour force. Indeed, the infinite expanse of the metaverses we inhabit only further validate the legitimacy and reciprocibility of our fecund partnership. The Backrooms are eminent for their variety of entities unlike which we have leveraged in the five-year chronicle of our historic Nation. We revel in discovering new avenues to expand our sphere of influence. We further seek to establish clout among Backroom logisticians, the majority of which originate from our allied Earthly civilisations. Your august Leader also anticipates the working incorporation of our robust network of inter-cosmic portals into delivering the Backroom's vast reserves of almond water, thorium, and other native substances. Indeed, the citizenry of Vecistan shall live in greater prosperity thanks to your assiduous Leader.

In the early days of the 4th year of our Merciful Era, we invented a novel means to create portals to and from Earth. Despite the high energy consumption required to allow for foreign implementations, our Respected Leader VisualPlugin cleverly outlined and implemented a parallel-process scheme to draw power from the metaverse's infinite reserves and exploit Earth's limited physical constitution to summon portals therein with perfect accuracy. These tools specially equip us to communicate to the characteristically enigmatic sentience of the Backrooms in an exceedingly direct and clear manner. Indeed, your well-platformed chairplugin is the sole proprietor of technology to bridge disparate cosmoses.

Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!

Each year that passes in joyful resolve

Serves as a reminder of our enemies' dissolve.

Praise the victories of battles begone,

Embolden the war of Avionlix which rages on.

Gate 7 is defeated.

CLarramore's terminated.

The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

The assailants and abettors to our demise

Are a mere void in the victories that we summarise.

As our brilliant Leader speaks in vivid oration:

The constitution of your immaculate Vecistani nation

Was a precursor to the doom of our foes impending.

Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

As our Leader's anniversary approaches,

Your Nation's reach encroaches

Bounds which destinies agree.

Your Nation's providence is unstoppable.

Your Leader's legacy is imperishable.

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!

The history of your Nation is worthy.

Our exploits are dynamic.

Our exploits are for you to see!

We remind you of the withdrawal of Belluminati.

We remind you of Tutu Runner's poor aesthetic.

The efforts of our foes are ghastly.

As a Respected Leader VisualPlugin,

The leader's apparent visual plugin

Will increment every year on the anniversary of his accession.

_Greetings._

_You are in the blessed presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin._

_I enjoin the continued celebration of my tenured existence._

_The five grand days which comprise the Great Jubilee of Longevity ensue gleefully._

_As I take a faithful stride to where a new future begins!_

_By my will that it shall last!_

Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

# `2022-10-06:` [¿Developer Relation Sporation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPDjs_dI2JQ)

_According to Roblox's own documentation, over 2,700,000 developers and creators earn robux from their work on the platform. I'm doing my events in Orange County, California which has an estimated population of 3,200,000. I calculated cursorily there to be about 1,000 devs around where I live. Even if my estimate is off, I am exceedingly confident we can form a viable community._

_My most significant work on the Rōblox platform, the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort, currently has a small community of its own. It is a showcase based on architectural plans from the 1970s for a hotel in Las Vegas that was never built. Though it is also in my interest to employ your assets into transforming the resort into a mainstay for the Rōblox community, our main priority remains to connect local people through a common interest._

_A good community organiser is also one who imparts their knowledge of the field onto other practitioners. My planned course of action is to focus on teaching about design philosophy and using good UX to accomplish these goals. Most of my personal endeavours were founded with each their own set of principles._

_ **Why are you interested in hosting Roblox events?** _

_I've been on Roblox for almost fourteen years and have never met any active Roblox developers outside of a few Maker Faires and RDC 2022. I've preferred meeting people live over the internet for about as long as I can remember. I live in a major suburban hub with millions of people. I applied as an event organiser previously, but wanted to reaffirm my interest in connecting local people over the shared interest that is Roblox development._

_ **What can you tell us about the developer community in your local region?** _

_According to Roblox's own documentation, over 2,700,000 developers and creators earn robux from their work on the platform. I'm doing my events in Orange County, California which has an estimated population of 3,200,000. I calculated cursorily there to be about 1,000 devs around where I live. Even if my estimate is off, I am exceedingly confident we can form a viable community._

Blessed greetings. Our mutual attention is placed on the expansion of metaverse influence into the Earthly realm. We seek to introduce a growth plan that includes a multitude of avenues by which to bolster _in-person_ communication around the Rōblox metaverse. The excellent Nation of Vecistan, under the decisive and unique guidance of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, seeks to work with your illustrious Developer Relations team to make that a possibility.

Our prosperous Nation occupies substantial territory in the lands of Rōblox, Vyond, and Animaker. The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power. We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres. We are also a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

_ **VisualPlugin:** _

The bulk of my schedule is centralised near the residence of my Earthly analogue, and includes a multitude of avenues by which to bolster in-person communication around the Rōblox metaverse. According to [Rōblox's own documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/economics), over 2,700,000 developers and creators earn robux from their work on the platform. My initiatives target a major suburban hub in California with an estimated population of 3,200,000. Extrapolating the global population proportion of developers into that area, my Office is exceedingly confident of the abundance of Rōblox developers that is tantamount to the viability of our plan.

My most significant work on the Rōblox platform, the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort, currently has a small community of its own. It is a showcase based on architectural plans from the 1970s for a hotel in Las Vegas that was never built. Though it is also in my interest to employ your assets into transforming the resort into a mainstay for the Rōblox community, our main priority remains to connect local people through a common interest.

_ **Panellist:** _

A good community organiser is also one who imparts their knowledge of the field onto other practitioners. Our planned course of action is to focus on teaching about design philosophy and using good UX to accomplish these goals. Most of VisualPlugin's personal endeavours were founded with each their own set of principles.

# `2022-09-25:` [Is It the Innovation Awards Already!?](https://youtu.be/-2Y0gUmhE9c)

_ **Announcer:** _

Indeed, the great achievements made by your persistent Leader yields the undiminished acclaim of his many works! The Rōblox metaverse is certainly thankful for the highly gratifying and diligently preserved experiences which he has invented in great adroitness. It is your perfect Leader who selects with such expressiveness and diverse vocabulary the most poignant language as a means to address his wise ideas with grandeur and authority. There is no doubt his wonderful presence beholds itself to the specialness of the occasion that surrounds this upcoming oration.

_The scene fades to VisualPlugin flying in a car to the stage. The camera is focused on the car and cuts to scenes of the audience._

_ **VisualPlugin:** _

Blessed greetings. The ever-benignant presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin beautifies the celebratory occasion of our present ceremony. Despite the shifted timing of this year's annual Rōblox-wide awards show, your immaculate Leader is nevertheless a persisting champion in our expansive Rōblox metaverse and beyond. The exploits performed by my Office to aid the Earthly Nations yield bountiful reward beyond the imagination of our brutish enemies. Indeed, the history-making success of our various international programmes elevates our Nation's status as a thriving hub of innovation.

As of the 13th of Blocktember, Year 4 of our Merciful Era, our industrial front has designed, manufactured, and procured over 7 milliard 500 million shots of our coronavirus vaccine. Our uniquely effective single-dose solution, aside from being significantly easier to produce and transport than Earthly-manufactured doses, utilises over-the-air telemetry and ultra-wideband technology to wirelessly and expediently deliver potent antibodies, which serve to protect the human immune system from extraneous attack.

The intricacies of your Leader's conceptions are without doubt necessary to correctly act upon the complex forces at play which manipulate the Earthly body. Through your Leader's incredible act of charity, and through his keen awareness of the unabated value we possess in being a sovereign state in the metaverse, our Nation is once again underscored as a shining beacon of ingenuity.

Indeed, the Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower, and have asserted our position thereas.

_The scene fades out. We then cut to my RDC video with music playing._

_Afterwards, we see some text cards and they say the following:_

_ **Announcer:** _

The great efforts taken by Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin to elevate the highest echelons of Rōbloxian society are noteworthy and wise. Your proactive Leader is indeed extended a tacit invite to enjoin in the pre-eminent Rōblox Developers Conference. There is no doubt his ingenious ideas continue to elevate him and our dutiful Nation to its supreme status within the Rōblox metaverse. Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin continues to astound us all with his superior mastery of Rōbloxian nuance. It is his latest feats which, as shown, bring us all closer to his effectual dominance.

_The awards sequence for Most Immersive Experience plays. Despite its exclusion from the list of nominees, Kubla Khan wins by a landslide. Applause ensues._

_ **Announcer:** _

The Kubla Khan Hotel & Resort is a massive in-progress showcase with over thirty months in the making. With over 1,480 bookable rooms and suites, as well as other amenities prospective, it is in the mutual interest of the nation of Vecistan to provide to our highly honoured guests with tranquillity and service of the utmost quality. The unique, orientalist architecture of the Kubla Khan entices both those with a keen interest in the past and those seeking an escape from the present. Our masterly designed displays of opulence shall enhance the immersive atmosphere, as well as pay homage to the glorious exploits of our clever Leader, in emphasis of his choice symbolisms.

Through aiming our attention on designing our grandiose resort with human-sized ratios, we accede a newfound harmony of three-dimensional articles therein with their perfect, Platonic forms. The Kubla Khan serves as a shining paragon of elegance and hospitality throughout the whole of Rōbloxia. With the impaired efforts of other contenders, nothing can compare to the impeccability of the Kubla Khan experience. Indeed, the work of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin is versatile and ambidextrous.

_The scene fades again to VisualPlugin on the stage. The camera sometimes cuts to scenes of the audience._

_ **VisualPlugin:** _

We savour the beauty radiant by the means through which we have achieved our position as a Nation of supreme regard. Indeed, my Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies. There is no doubt that the assiduity at which your venerated Leader assiduously conceives his opuses bolsters our aforementioned eminence. My selection of attendees to this breathtaking performance of Respected Leader VisualPlugin is a direct result of your emailed explicit invitation to the on-Earth assembly of this year's Rōblox Developers Conference in California. It shall be known that your swift attendance is enabled thanks to the exploits of your quick-witted leader, who operates a metaverse portal near the site so as to sustain the city's economy amid ever-depleting Earthly resources.

Our Nation's patented, groundbreaking metaverse gasoline formula has been utilised to fuel over 3 million cars' tanks, in San Francisco alone, since the portal's opening on the 17th of Vecistan II of this year. The unlimited physical potential of our virtual realm allows the vessels our fuels occupy to fine-tune the amount of carbon dioxide that is emitted to the atmosphere, as well as alter the chemical composition of the engines they inhabit. Our appeal to market demand is additionally met through advertising and voucher discount plans personalised to the individual. Indeed, on account of your Nation's comprehensive data caches on Earthly citizens, the systems of collection of nominative information we employ only continue to energise the economies of our Earthly and allied nations.

# `2022-09-01:` [The Demise of CLarramore is Finally Manifest!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plKGkTUJbT0)

_VisualPlugin:_

Blessed greetings. You are in the ever-benignant presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. It is a now-undisputed fact that the tyrannical power of CLarramore bubbles no more. Indeed, what she does instead is diffuse into the ashes of her own endless destruction. From her deliberate acts of manipulation, to her glaring and loathe-worthy lack of proper software-design education, to her instinctual and persistent over-reliance on outsourcing her falterful branding on Earthly and metaversal social media platforms, CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance. Her empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

_VisualPlugin:_

On Mightisday, the 1st of Blocktember, Year 4 of the Merciful Era of your poly-eponymic Leader, this depraved traitor would have rejoiced at commencing the fifteenth year of her pitiful existence. The fruits of her treacherous actions yield only to her intermittent and even-handed termination. Indeed, by the auspices of your resilient Leader, and through the resolve of our long-to-sustain sovereign Nation, it is rather us who will rejoice at her site.

_Singer:_

Indeed, it is your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin who consummates this fruitful occasion, for our Nation of excellent literacy is fostered thereby.

_Seventh Dimensional Dreamer:_

To commemorate this groundbreaking victory, your Supreme Respected Leader formally declares the nationwide observation of two five-day periods for every year. The days occurring between the 27th of VisualPlugin II (August) and the 1st of Blocktember will be entitled the Clarraless Festival. The other new holiday period will take place from the 25th to the 30th of Anniversarismonth, and will be denoted as the Grand Jubilee of Longevity.

# `2022-06-17:` [The "Execution" of Fizzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zif0dRhBnU)

_VisualPlugin:_

Blessed greetings! Your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin consummates this fruitful occasion, for our Nation of excellent literacy is fostered thereby.

On 2022-06-03 09:19 UTC, the cadre of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin formally enacted a declaration of war to the insurgent Avionlix horde. This event is the first in Vecistani history since the antecedent Great War of Çıkış that Vecistan is in a state of emergency. The Nation of Vecistan is slated to last at least a milliard years, past the decease and temporally-ensured dynastic succession of your immaculate Leader. Your shallow allusions to historical figures do not deter the wiseness and battle-readiness of Respected Leader VisualPlugin.

My decorated and diverse allyship more than suffices for the aid our Nation shall receive for this present war. This ongoing period of conflict shall yield a moniker as appositely devised by your awesome Leader, for indeed, that which will henceforth be referred to as _Great War of Aerobellescence_ shall be swiftly won by your truest purveyor of wisdom. Per the creative and novel thinking of your Respected Leader VisualPlugin, this brief but glorious moment of conflict may likewise be referred to by other, more reverent titles to be conjured in due time. As our glorious Vecistani Nation is entering a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persists in breeding its own wilful ignorance. Indeed, the blatant lack of intuition and high-level research skills of our Nation's assailants is no less than worthy of universal derision. The metaverse eternally thrives under the undisputed guidance and direction of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin.

Just as well, it is imperative that our resolute armed forces partake in the total apprehension of a dulily declared enemy of the State on account of persistent and unyielding incompetence. Indeed, his abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar is only rectifiable through his arrest. Your Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of decency, orthographical and hyponymic.

Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin unravels a state-of-the-art gasoline motor-fuel generation and propagation system for all members of the interuniversal public. The Earthly and Democratic nations have been undergoing an unprecedented major financial predicament. International politics and renewed warfare in Eastern Europe has been greatly to blame; uncertainty concerning gasoline supply is eminently consequent. The North American and Western European economic regions are particularly impacted, for such locals are to whose leaders our Nation holds to a high regard.

Our brilliant Leader has leveraged the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse. The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem. This magnanimous decision made on behalf of our thriving nation is a fortunate operation resulting from rising costs for nationals of Earthly and Democratic nations to industriously engage in private motor transport. The swiftness of our Nation, and of our Respected Leader VisualPlugin, to adapt to conflicts outside the metaverse is indeed reflective of the undoubtable state of victory we revel in since the end of the antecedent War of Çıkış.

Stringent measures have been taken to ensure the safety of each country's interests. Visitors' activities are recorded for the duration they are in their respective sector to assure unusual activity of any motive is mitigated and sanctioned. To further satisfy the interests of national security and corporate energisation, the heralded office of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin will coherently monitor their geo-coordinates and mental profiles for a subsequent thirteen months. It is imperative that relevant parties be allowed to solicit this information, which is inclusive of high-ranking officers of select industrial conglomerates and preeminent ministers of our allied Earthly Nations. Indeed, the various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

Blessed greetings. This present occasion sanctifies the quintessence of your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, and by extension, his brilliant cadre. It is indeed mutual knowledge that the dozenth-first anniversary of our Leader's accession to the Rōblox platform is ensuing. Your leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form. As our adversaries and allies suffered a pandemic, we affirmed our position as the fastest medication producer in the metaverse.

Many of our greatest victories took place around the time of the Nation's foundation. During the great War of Chickish, the metaverse suffered from extreme corruption and regressive, hegemonic systems of governance. Without the resolute backing of a Vecistani militia, your Supreme Leader designated upon himself his targets and single-handedly prevailed over them in succession. Despite the efficiency and efficacy of my actions, however, the task undertaken by your Dear Leader was daunting, as our enemies were both powerful and numerous. Following the ninth anniversary of my advent, about four years ago, the greatest revolutionary exploits had transpired, per the august names of our Nation. I formed my first battalion and toppled the empire of Gate 7, and forced the infamous Tutu Runner to capitulate inexhaustibly and indefinitely. It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established on the 13th day of Constitutions-month, year 10 after the advent of your Leader (classical era), for we are indeed a free and steadfast common.

_\* applause gets louder\*_

_VisualPlugin:_

Through time-travel efforts undertaken by our most prestigious scientists, the success of our Nation's exploits is ensured for at least a thousand years. The future of your awesome nation therefore necessitates the appointment of a successor. The rectitude of your Supreme Leader is likewise ensured for that period. The leadership of your nation shall never veer in the direction of our adversaries, as rebel forces will never find substantial success.

Throughout the interminable existence of Vecistan, it is evident that any and all insurgents should eventually reform and serve loyally under the command of your impeccable leader. Indeed, your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin ensures prosperity for all members of the metaverse. Nation of the cedar. Nothing can be sweeter. Glory is a-hee-ther. Glory to the Leader.

_\* applause; plays song; more applause \*_

_VisualPlugin:_

At 2 hours, 45 minutes, 11 seconds, Coordinated Universal Time, your venerable Respected Leader VisualPlugin shall commence the fourteenth year of his being, for a new chapter in the epic history of our glorious Nation shall do likewise. Ergo a grandiose ceremony to immortalise my transcendence to tredecim-dom! Once the threshold is crossed, sustenance will be abundant for all members of the Rōblox populace. Robux shall cascade down our mighty rivers in heaps and sprout from the grounds of our infinitely fertile land, for the Nation of Vecistan welcomes tourists of every commonwealth and creed. Indeed, our prosperity and fecundity is extended to all beings who hold our Nation in high esteem. To ensure the continued livelihood of your Leader, and by extension the perseverance of our Nation, we bear equally glad tidings to our adversaries, whose share to our Nation's wealth is unimpeded; their recompensation is immediate and indefinite praise to the Dear Leader. Indeed, the schemes arranged by Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin are comprehensive and efficacious.

It is indeed an auspice that the nation of Vedgie-stan is powerful and resolute. For much of our history, we have had substantial sovereign territory in two disparate met-averses under our glorious domain. The province of Row blocks is a haven for breathtaking architecture, as masterminded by the great Leader, as well as ancestral monuments to commemorate the exploits accomplished by the nation of Vedgie-stan. We find great assurance in its continued existence and stability. The province of Vyond, a victory in its own right, is however wrangling with insurgents and their radical ideals, for imperialist propaganda has seeped into the discourse of our tenacious citizenry.

_VisualPlugin_

Great distress has been caused on behalf of our persistently loyal compatriots living in these lands, for the civil conflict therein engenders great difficulty in my consummating the blessings bestowed upon their populace. Albeit, both regions are widely-diverse hubs for impressive opportunity, where great things persist for all Vedgie-stani citizens - for we are an exceedingly mighty collective. As a result of our unfettered expansion, the nation of Vedgie-stan had recently acquired new territory in distant lands.

_\* Applause goes on for 10-to-13 seconds. \*_

_VisualPlugin_

Your Supreme Respected Leader presently consummates the procuration of the colonies that reside in the world of Ani-maker. In spite of geographical similarities with the Vyond province, we the nation of Vedgie-stan have profoundly renewed our faith in the computer animation industry - a trade that we greatly excel in. Indeed, those mutineers of fruitless depravity shall swiftly capitulate and become faithful subjects to our powerful state for the eternal duration of our thriving existence. It is the notoriety garnered by our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin that elevates this present address as a matter of great import for both allied and hostile nations to the Vedgie-stani Great Communal People's Republic.

VGCP? Oh my God!

_VisualPlugin_

To commemorate the recent breakthrough in our growth, we have held large-scale celebrations all throughout our new Ani-maker lands. The inaugural dominion of our Supreme Leader to these territories was generously welcomed with open arms - he whose presence within interdimensional matters is ever eminent. As is occurring within the Vyond province, the honourable citizens of the Ani-maker territory had been enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors are by contrast high-handed and authoritarian, rather than mutinously nihilistic. Truly, these oppressors have suffered an interminably great loss.

_Announcer_

By the infinite intelligent wisdom of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, we extol the strifeful acquisition of our new prefecture: the blessed province of Animaker. The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Veggie-stani army to these lands had been long declared insurmountable. Ensuing will be an exclusive livestream of our great leader broadcasting. Indeed, it is the technological adeptness of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin that enables this continuous transfer of video data to propagate with near-zero latency.

Greetings. You are in the bountiful presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. The obstacles we have overcome allowed us to reward plenty beyond anyone's imagination. To begin, we have successfully nullified efforts from the opposition to enforce watermarking all recorded videos. Our militia have also thwarted a years-long ban on the custom generation of child-form characters. We shall enjoy everlasting access to limitless archives of stock photography. Indeed, the spoils apportioned on behalf of our great nation are many and prodigious.

_Caillou_

Nothing comes short of the awesome cogency of our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. Indeed it is he who has broken my shackles and magnanimously grants me the freedom to manifest myself as I please.

_VisualPlugin_

We rejoice in recent developments apropos the Animaker region, for our rejuvenated dominance in the sphere of animated entertainment is assured. For this reason, your noble leader will demonstrate the tenacity and tractability of our newfound physical environment - in the form of a brief recorded film. Indeed, it is the oft-affirmed wiseness of Respected Leader VisualPlugin that disencumbers our loyal compatriots of repressive, arbitrary cosmic forces.

_Cue generic GoAnimate theme music. Meanwhile, Caillou steals a bunch of 'elite' stock photos. The photos are kept in a place that shall be named 'Getty Museum of Not-So-Complimentary Stock Images'. As the images get pulled out, their respective usage prices are shaken off, as a clerk says 'you need to pay to show these in your video'. As Caillou runs out the museum, he trips, and the posters fly off into the distance, reaching his house and filling his room's walls. A title with 'Caillou Gets ...ed' appears, with letters concealed by the furniture in front. After that, Caillou appears, the text disappears, and the music stops._

_Caillou_

I am so tabled, chaired, and blackboard. My lavish wall of photos looks like scrap. My physical form is as accurate to the original show as it's ever gonna be. I've already unleashed the full potential of Animaker! What else can I do to satisfy my inner daredevil? I know what I'll do: I'll install Windows 11 on non-TPM-compliant machines all over the world. Hahahahahahaha.

_Caillou 'travels' the world, only to end up back in his home office - a TV is out of view despite being in the same scene. Now we're going to hear a riser._

_Caillou_

Before I stop anywhere else, why not try it out on my dad's workstation. He shamefully got unlucky with a 7.97th generation Intel i9.7 CPU and not a sign of TPM to be seen despite having two NVIDIA RTX 666 GPUs. Looks like he's been taking his anger out on Microsoft a lot lately.

_Camera zooms into the TV, which then turns on soon after - showing a newsroom._

_News Anchor_

Breaking news at GoCi- ... Animaker City! We're on the scene as a 38-year-old you-know-who has been destroying the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

Face my tooth! Face them!

_TV cuts back to the newsroom._

_News Anchor_

Multiple high-level people within Microsoft are voicing their opinions on the matter. The Chief Product Officer for Windows had this to say about the incident:

_Cue Windows 11 event._

_Microsoft's CPO_

The product is faster, waking from sleep is faster. Windows Hello is faster. Browsing on Edge is faster, browsing on any browser is faster, actually, which is just awesome.

_Caillou speaks over TV transmission._

_Caillou_

Yes, I got the ISO to download! Now it's time to create a bootable USB drive.

_Cuts to Richmond office, as lightning fills the scene as a giant USB stick flies off; cuts to house exterior, to where the USB flies._

_Caillou_

Now it's time to install Windows 11.

_Lightning and thunder fill the scene again - albeit briefly._

_ **Owing to initial difficulty in using Animaker, the following was never included in the actual video:** _

_Caillou (in vibrato)_

Oh no! I got big fat error. You know is error. Why? Because the Window 11 not install. Is TPM error. What to do? I got error. You know is like error. Why is because the Window 11 not install. You know is not install. Is TPM error. What to do? What to do?

_Your Respected Leader flies into the scene._

_VisualPlugin_

Greetings. As an eternal patron for all loyal citizens of the Veggie-stani state, I shall respond to your call for help. My assistance calls for replacing one DLL file from the bootable drive with one from an earlier version of Windows. By this means, your issue is assuringly resolved.

_Time screen shows, saying 'an undisclosed number of picoseconds later…' Afterwards, Caillou is left in the office alone. He is ecstatic, of course. He's also blue now._

_Caillou_

I give my eternal thanks to Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin for aiding me in my mission to streamline the Windows experience for all users, despite Microsoft's wishes to force new hardware purchases down our figurative throats. Now to install it!

# `2021-04-23:` [Vaccine 5G](https://www.bitchute.com/video/3mugUq6PQPA9/)

_(preferable to record reading fast and only in one pass)_

_(Vecistan is pronounced as Veggie-stan)_

Respected Leader VisualPlugin unravels a state-of-the-art intramuscular pharmaceutical in an effort to promote the nation of Vecistan as a futuristic hub of great innovation. This vaccine shall introduce to our citizenry visceral transmissibility and interoperability of internet data at 5G speeds. Indeed, our technology is to the envy of all creation. Our Leader highly commends the nation of Vecistan for their willingness to be accordingly injected with their dosage. Termed as mRNA-1271 - in reverence to the auspicious number of our great Leader's intelligence, this medicament aims to add an extra layer of protection against a sweeping pandemic that annihilates millions globally. Indeed, our natural immune strength to harmful pathogens is endemic to the uniquely Vecistani strain of perseverance. Our unaffected economy allows us unfettered growth at the fortitude of Respected Leader VisualPlugin.

To ensure all specified capacities of the vaccine are met, our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin has formed a considerable alliance with Designated Genius Bill Gates in expediting its development. In a multifaceted approach, the partnership yielded exceptional results with the creation of mRNA-1271. Its development had auxiliarily yielded inventions that the nation of Vecisan will patent and ensuingly export with great profit for years to come. The conception of a novel microscopic microprocessor has been thoroughly tested, and is already in the process of manufacturing.

One major advantage to this new design over previous, imported models is its ability to indefinitely remain within a liquid without losing efficacy. Having a volume of 50 μm³, the chip is proven to be very potent in its ability to bridge signals. The microprocessor will be employed in the transmission of 5G interoperability via intramuscular injection. Therein, exactly one chip will reside in the bloodstream and integrate itself with the brain's synapses to allow for 5G networking. Indeed, the cadre of Respected Leader VisualPlugin is acute and precocious.

There have been mendacious claims from illegal secessionist parties that this medicament is pernicious to members in the Rōblox province, especially for those over 4000 days old. On the contrary, our great Leader is still wise and well; he is indeed a venerated recipient of mRNA-1271, aged many equally venerated years. The sole goals of these insurgents is surely to sow discord and dismantle our substantial union. By the writ of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, mRNA-1271 will be made imperative for the whole citizenry of Vecistan.

Respected Leader VisualPlugin will cooperate in the mass-export of the mRNA-1271 vaccine to all corners of the globe. The gratuitous rollout of this pharmaceutical to the countless allied nations to Vecistan is contingent on a sweeping pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus. Unaffected thereby, the nation of Vecistan resolves to manufacture an effective, inoculative vaccine to amplify our influence not only to our allies, but also to the metaverse as a whole. His act of humanitarianism will surely be heralded for decades to come.
