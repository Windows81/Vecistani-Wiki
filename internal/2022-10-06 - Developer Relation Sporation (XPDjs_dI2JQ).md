_According to Roblox's own documentation, over 2,700,000 developers and creators earn robux from their work on the platform. I'm doing my events in Orange County, California which has an estimated population of 3,200,000. I calculated cursorily there to be about 1,000 devs around where I live. Even if my estimate is off, I am exceedingly confident we can form a viable community._

_My most significant work on the Rōblox platform, the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort, currently has a small community of its own. It is a showcase based on architectural plans from the 1970s for a hotel in Las Vegas that was never built. Though it is also in my interest to employ your assets into transforming the resort into a mainstay for the Rōblox community, our main priority remains to connect local people through a common interest._

_A good community organiser is also one who imparts their knowledge of the field onto other practitioners. My planned course of action is to focus on teaching about design philosophy and using good UX to accomplish these goals. Most of my personal endeavours were founded with each their own set of principles._

_I designed the Kubla Khan with as few artificial intrusions as possible. This meant withdrawing from implementing invisible walls and on-screen GUIs. Anything that breaks the immersion of being in a hotel resort is accounted for in my design plan. It is my hope to share not only my high-level modes of thought more extensively with a local community, but also to show practical tips that can best be relayed through doing the work itself. Having had the opportunity to network with other event organisers at this year's Rōblox Developers Conference, I extend warm delights to cooperate on behalf of the Event Organiser team!_

**Why are you interested in hosting Roblox events?**

_I've been on Roblox for almost fourteen years and have never met any active Roblox developers outside of a few Maker Faires and RDC 2022. I've preferred meeting people live over the internet for about as long as I can remember. I live in a major suburban hub with millions of people. I applied as an event organiser previously, but wanted to reaffirm my interest in connecting local people over the shared interest that is Roblox development._

**What can you tell us about the developer community in your local region?**

**If you have previous experience organising events, please describe.**

_I sometimes volunteer at Islamic Institute of Orange County and have taken leadership roles at a few recent events._

Blessed greetings. Our mutual attention is placed on the expansion of metaverse influence into the Earthly realm. We seek to introduce a growth plan that includes a multitude of avenues by which to bolster _in-person_ communication around the Rōblox metaverse. The excellent Nation of Vecistan, under the decisive and unique guidance of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, seeks to work with your illustrious Developer Relations team to make that a possibility.

Our prosperous Nation occupies substantial territory in the lands of Rōblox, Vyond, and Animaker. The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power. We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres. We are also a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

The bulk of my schedule is centralised near the residence of my Earthly analogue, and includes a multitude of avenues by which to bolster in-person communication around the Rōblox metaverse. According to [Rōblox's own documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/economics), over 2,700,000 developers and creators earn robux from their work on the platform. My initiatives target a major suburban hub in California with an estimated population of 3,200,000. Extrapolating the global population proportion of developers into that area, my Office is exceedingly confident of the abundance of Rōblox developers that is tantamount to the viability of our plan.

My most significant work on the Rōblox platform, the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort, currently has a small community of its own. It is a showcase based on architectural plans from the 1970s for a hotel in Las Vegas that was never built. Though it is also in my interest to employ your assets into transforming the resort into a mainstay for the Rōblox community, our main priority remains to connect local people through a common interest.
