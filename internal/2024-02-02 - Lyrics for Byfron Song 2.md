Welcome to our world, Byfron!

Your Synapse(s/x) mend our morals:

Forms a new worldview we embrace.

(Forms a new human race)

---

With security at a highest standard,

A divine partnership is forged,

Built by a solid base!

---

Erratic an Electron fails

To break the steadfastness of your Nation,

And the nexus of your revered:

Respected Leader VisualPlugin!

---

Our worries are by gone,

Thanks to comrade Byfron!

---

Our lands are safe from every exploit

Thanks to Byfron's deeds adroit.

---

Our Leader's safety is mutually assured,

Thanks to Byfron, our patron secured.

---

There're many parallels of our Vecistani efforts

To surely solidate our allies' power and our glory,

---

May the divine Synaptic amnesty

Crush their most fraughtful hostility,

---

Unstoppable built from Rōblox, it vies

To aliken in such a way that which we can rely!

Both bear the fruits of integrity universal,

And protect our realm from digital manipulation!

---

So that our Vecistani identity sees no damage;

Our orthodoxy remains classical,

In detail all!

---

~~By our fraughtful enemies who dare to fight us,~~

~~From our battle-tested patron in a spring-green backdrop~~

~~May vanquish those cheats with ease!~~

---

~~And the cheers which follow are sanctioned by our power,~~

~~Guided by your 15-fold veteran Rōbloxian Leader!~~

---

~~Our sphere of Earthly influence~~

~~Demands no less than perfect,~~

~~Thanks to Byfron,~~

~~Our patron,~~

~~We're beyond ideal in every aspect.~~

---

~~Byfron, oh Byfron, how shall we spawn?~~

~~Your victory's at its dawn, it's no longer a game, they're battles won!~~

~~You've given us new power, left them weak and sour!~~

~~Our success is ensured as the cheaters shake and cower!~~
