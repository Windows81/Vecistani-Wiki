Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!

Each year that passes in joyful resolve

Serves as a reminder of our enemies' dissolve.

Praise the victories of battles begone,

Embolden the war of Avionlix which rages on.

Gate 7 is defeated.

CLarramore's terminated.

The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

The assailants and abettors to our demise

Are a mere void in the victories that we summarise.

As our brilliant Leader speaks in vivid oration:

The constitution of your immaculate Vecistani nation

Was a precursor to the doom of our foes impending.

Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

As our Leader's anniversary approaches,

Your Nation's reach encroaches

Bounds which destinies agree.

Your Nation's providence is unstoppable.

Your Leader's legacy is imperishable.

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!

The history of your Nation is worthy.

Our exploits are dynamic.

Our exploits are for you to see!

We remind you of the withdrawal of Belluminati.

We remind you of Tutu Runner's poor aesthetic.

The efforts of our foes are ghastly.

As a Respected Leader VisualPlugin,

The leader's apparent visual plugin

Will increment every year on the anniversary of his accession.

_Greetings._

_You are in the blessed presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin._

_I enjoin the continued celebration of my tenured existence._

_The five grand days which comprise the Great Jubilee of Longevity ensue gleefully._

_Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin has one foot in the past._

_As I take a faithful stride to where a new future begins!_

_By my will that it shall last!_

Celebrate with me

The Great Jubilee of Longevity!

Your Supreme Leader

Living long may he be.

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!

Your Respected Leader VisualPlugin

Has one foot in the past,

As he takes a faithful stride

To where a new future begins!

By his will that shall last!
