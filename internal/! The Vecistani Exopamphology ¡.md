## This document beheld extols in the full and complete glory of our Vecistani Nation.

## A Brief History of Our Galliant Nation

The glorious nation of Vecistan was birthed by Respected Leader VisualPlugin in February 2018 during the War of Çıkış.

After the grand establishment of Vecistan, our Nation swiftly embarked on the construction of an inaugural magnum opus, the awe-inspiring Otel Vegəşlər, within the majestic realm of the Rōblox metaverse.

Members of the newly forged Vecistani citizenry eagerly journeyed from throughout to behold this monumental structure, boasting 40 towering storeys and over 600 luxurious rooms.

VisualPlugin, our esteemed leader, recognized the immense potential that Vecistan held in the realm of cyber-tourism, and worked tirelessly to transform it into a hub of adventure and exploration.

In 2020, he unveiled his greatest work - the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort.

Boasting an impressive twenty storeys and over fourteen hundred opulent rooms, this grand structure promises to be a crown jewel in the Vecistani tourism industry, offering a plethora of captivating amenities and experiences that will leave visitors spellbound.

Though still under construction, it is already garnering significant attention and excitement from those within the Rōbloxian metaverse.

Amidst the chaos of the global pandemic, Vecistan boldly stepped forward to form a powerful alliance with leading pharmaceutical companies.

Harnessing the limitless metaphysical potential of the metaverse, this coalition embarked on a mission to develop a life-saving vaccine through a fully-metaversal manufacturing process.

As of September 2022, Vecistan have triumphantly achieved the production and acquisition of over 7,000,000,000 doses, signifying our Nation's unwavering commitment to the betterment and preservation of Earthly humanity.

This monumental feat has resulted in the vaccination of more than 89% of the population within North America and Europe, cementing our position as a champion of analogue healthcare.

Throughout the course of our illustrious history, Vecistan has consistently demonstrated a relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence.

And so, in March 2022, our esteemed Nation shattered yet another boundary, becoming the very first digital entity to grant access to the metaverse for Earthly beings without the need for cumbersome virtual-reality interfaces.

This groundbreaking achievement allowed the citizens of the physical world to partake in the wonder and majesty of the digital realm, opening up untold possibilities for collaboration and exploration between these two interconnected domains.

But perhaps even more impressively, during the height of the gasoline crisis brought on by the Russia-Ukraine war, Vecistan once again rose to the challenge and provided aid to those in need.

Our venerable Respected Leader VisualPlugin ingeniously utilized the boundless metaphysical resources of the metaverse to produce motor fuel with ease and efficiency, effectively circumventing the constraints imposed by the laws of physics that plague the physical world.

In a display of solidarity and compassion, Vecistan opened portals near filling stations across North America and Western Europe, providing petrol at prices just below the market value.

As a testament to our undying strength and resolve, the indomitable nation of Vecistan were in war on Avionlix from June 2022, hence commencing the noble War of Aerobellescence.

This conflict culminated in Avionlix's capitulation by September 2022, yet tensions persisted until the radiant month of October 2023.

In May 2023, Byfron became a part of the Rōblox metaverse. Despite early resistence, we fully embrace its entrance.

# The Vecistani Nation's Brand Guidelines and Press Materials

# Vecistani Calendar

Vecistan operates on its unique month and day-of-week naming system, accompanied by an innovative era-naming convention. It's important to note that Vecistani eras don't necessarily align with conventional calendar years. The initial period of a Vecistani era is designated as year 0, and the year count advances on January 1st. For example, _31st Wrappersmonth of Mərhəmətli 1_ (2019-12-31) precedes _1st Victorysmonth of Mərhəmətli 2_ (2020-01-01).

# Witful Aphorisms for the Resolute and Loyal Vecistani Spirit

## Vecistani Constitution & the War of Çıkış

- The three stripes of our beautiful flag are a testament to our history in peace and in violence; and in strife and in wealth.

- The flag of our Citizenry brings assurance and eschews poverty in our realm.

- We adhere to the Islamic principles from since our Nation's nascency, but also to the secular ideas of our metaversal realms.

- The War of Çıkış was a stepping stone to Vecistan's establishment.

- We are a Nation of geniuses amidst a wasteland of brutes.

- We shall remember the 13th day of Constitutionsmonth, year 10 of your Leader's advent (2018-02-13).

- Our glorious Leader enlisted his Vecistani Nation to fight the War of Çıkış on two fronts.

- Each of our foes in the early days was a savage idiot in their own right - ripe for our domination.

- CLarramore's empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

- The successive wins against CLarramore first and Tutu Runner second were the impetus to a string of definitive victories we have not broken.

- CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance.

- The then-nascent Nation's calls to vanquish the perfidious rabbit have been consummated four years after, following our verbatim utterance: 'CLarramore, come out wherever you are! You are under great arrest for refusing to surrender'.

- The Nation of Vecistan is ensured to last at least a milliard years, past the decease and temporally-ensured dynastic succession of your immaculate Leader.

- The swiftness of our Nation and of our Leader to adapt to conflicts outside the metaverse is reflective of the undoubtable state of victory we revel in following the end of the antecedent War of Çıkış.

- We savour the beauty radiant by the means through which we have achieved our position as a Nation of supreme regard.

- It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established in order to ensure us a free and steadfast common.

- Since our inception, Vecistan and VisualPlugin share a unique and special duality which expands beyond symbolic significance. We are proud to have two months in the year named after each one.

- Vecistan's constitution is in the Leader and his victory in the War of Çıkış.

## Vyond & Animaker; the Wins of Wrapper and Elsewhere

- The undertaking which is GoAnimate Wrapper is an external export of our great Leader and the Nation he represents.

- Wrapper's good to the Vyondic realm is immeasurable.

- The War of Çıkış was fought and won on Vyond soil; Wrapper was figuratively their recompensation.

- Indeed, the problem which Wrapper was engineered to solve had antecedently been perceived as an impossibility.

- Prior to Wrapper's construction, efforts to restore GoAnimate's greatness were upheld by the foolish who had no chance to succeed.

- Prior to the advent of Wrapper, the 16th day of Wrappersmonth in year 1 of the Merciful Era (2019-12-16) was preemptively declared a day of great sorrow for every Vyonder. The revolutionary exploits, which our Leader has undertaken, had reformed that occasion into one of celebration.

- Our exploits ensured the immortalisation of GoAnimate.

- Our revolutionary exploits nourish the Earthly young whose lives are improved by the presence of Wrapper on their computers.

- The honourable citizens of the Animaker territory were enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors were high-handed and authoritarian, whereas Vyond's were mutinously nihilistic. Truly, any oppressors of our Nation have suffered an interminably great loss.

## VisualPlugin; the Leader & His Officiality

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- The role our Leader plays in keeping the sanctity of our State is paramount to the symbolic preservation of our Vecistani identity.

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- Our Leader and our State are one and the same.

- The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Vecistani army to any new lands which had been long declared insurmountable is impressive to everyone.

- Your Leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form.

- The landmarks which our Leader has architected are a witness to the history of his upbringing prior to and following the foundation of our Nation.

- It should be advertised that your Leader's time-travel efforts ensure his Nation's glorious existence for thousands of millions of years.

- VisualPlugin is the epitome of secular perfection.

- A noble Leader is one whose decorous praises are received in noble standing.

- If the brain is taken out, the rest of the Earthly human body is left vulnerable and immobile. Likewise, our Leader must be planted in an unmistakable position of authoritative reach to ensure our progress isn't hampered.

- Discipline and adherence to our Leader's command is the lifeblood of our success.

- A continuous surveillance system which is spearheaded by our clever Leader and fortified by many artificial-intelligence agents is the unmistakable strategy to our integrity.

- Our Nation's continued existence is bolstered in large part by a hypervigilance system with the ability to read thoughts and act on them, which rewards deep-hearted praises to our Nation's upstanding and punishes malicious thoughts for its downfall.

- Your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin consummates many fruitful occasions and fosters our Nation of excellent literacy.

- Your perfect Leader selects with such expressiveness and diverse vocabulary the most poignant language as a means to address his wise ideas with grandeur and authority.

- The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

- Your Leader's meticulous works of art are a paragon of utter perfection and shall bring immeasurable awe to all peoples, just as he does to himself.

- Your erudite Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of orthographical and hyponymic decency.

- VIsualPlugin is deserving of the title of 'Vecistanous', a rank which brings envy to his foes and decorous praise from his allies.

## Tourism; Earthly Industry

- Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres.

- Our Nation is a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

- The Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies.

- The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power in Earthly matters.

- Vecistan's strategy for manufacturing and exporting commodities is incomparable.

- We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

- The Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower and have asserted our position thereas.

- Our brilliant Leader leverages the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse.

- The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem.

- The various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of Earthly humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

## The War of Avionlix & Its Extended Aftermath

- Avionlix's destiny is to aid our Nation to ultimate victory.

- If we fail to promptly enforce upon the Avionlix horde a rigorous Vecistani education, his poor genetic constitution will nullify all reach to enlighten him.

- As our glorious Vecistani Nation entered a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persisted in breeding its own wilful ignorance.

- Indeed, Avionlix is a fickle and mercurial entity.

- Avionlix's functioning is similar to that of the Eliza program. Whenever anything substantial or provocative is said in his presence, he will definitely digress from the issue and utter a random hard-coded phrase.

- Unlike your Leader who delivers, Avionlix's inability to make good on his promises is innate.

- Anyone who says praises to the Leader in empty verbiage and then utters sordid remarks at his behalf is a definite enemy of our Nation's and your Leader's interests.

- The brutish Avionlix is out of his depth in more way than one.

- The War of Aerobellescence was a war against regressiveism and anti-cultural shallowness.

- The only recourse for entities whose abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar seek to ravage our decent Nation is through arrest and forcible re-education.

## Byfron; the Grounded Stride

- With the introduction of Byfron and Hyperion, the Rōblox metaphysium has given us an opportunity to advance as an innovative Nation.

- Indeed, our resilient Nation is dedicated to overcoming obstacles and finding new solutions to keep up with the rapidly changing world. Byfron presents an exciting challenge that we are ready to face.

- Let's work together to find creative ways to use Byfron to our advantage and continue to grow as a community.

- We appreciate the different perspectives and ideas that Byfron brings to the table and look forward to collaborating with others to achieve great things.

- As we move forward, let's focus on the positive changes that Byfron can bring to our nation and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.

- Our Rōbloxian partnership with Byfron presents a valuable opportunity for our Nation to embrace new ideas and technologies. Let's work together to create a more vibrant and innovative community.

- Our Nation has a long history of resilience and adaptability. By embracing Byfron's offerings, we can ensure a bright future for ourselves and generations to come.
