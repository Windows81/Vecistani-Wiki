# A Foreword for Your Nation's Incredible Exploits

Indeed it is he, **Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin**, whose wise deliberated words evoke the greatest of nationalistic spirits, for the manner by which he broadcasts his bountiful knowledge to both Vecistani and allied nationals is truly impeccable and highly coordinated.

Behold! Your impeccable **Respected Leader VisualPlugin** has established the Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic on the 13th of February 2018 in an effort to bring a decisive end to the Great War of Çıkış and to deliver justice against extreme corruption that was prominent in the metaverse. Our prosperous Nation occupies substantial territory in the lands of Rōblox, Vyond, and Animaker. With an infinite resource supply granted to us by the very nature of the metaverse, our Nation is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil.

Vecistan's Rōblox province is also a thriving hub of tourism and the nucleus of one of the most prodigious music record labels in the metaverse.

Our Vyond province, having previously been mostly occupied by the barbarian and nihilistic government of Gate 7, now boasts a new sense of freedom owing to our Leader's efforts to create and release GoAnimate Wrapper to all members of the Vyond public.

The province of Animaker is a monument to the unquestionable victory against high-handed and authoritarian forces that limited the freedom of expression of its populace. The efforts undertaken by our gracious Leader enabled the blessed citizens with free access to a vast library of paid stock photography, as well as the ability to utilise custom child-form characters for their creative works.

Indeed, the brilliance of **Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin** is boundless and multifaceted.

# About Us

The Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic (VGCPR), also known as Vecistan /vejistan/, is a wholly metaversal country within the Rōblox, Vyond, and Animaker metaverses, each of which constitute their own provinces. Citizens of Vecistan are referred to as Vecistanis.

## Etymology of 'Vecistan'

The name 'Vecistan' is loosely derived from one of VisualPlugin's architectural works that was under construction at the time of the nation's establishment: Otel Vegəşlər. The latter name contains an Azerbaijanisation of the word 'Vegas' in plural form, as in 'Las Vegas'.

## Linguistic History

In drafting Vecistan's manfesto, VisualPlugin constructed a language that 'sounds like Turkish but has Spanish grammar'. Despite an overwhelming majority of the population fluent in English, use of the conlang was used in mass-media and for conducting domestic business. The conlang was discontinued shortly after Vecistan's establishment. The de-facto language in Vecistan today is Vecistani English.

Vecistani English derives from modern British English but incorporates distinctive anachronisms, rendering it a unique variation.

## Mass Media

Vecistan's official state TV channel, sometimes referred to as the Vecistani Public Broadasting network, is the dominant media outlet for both internal and foreign affairs. Though much of early Vecistani programming was written dually in English and in their own home-grown conlang, all current programming is now solely in English.

ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL is the official ministry of music for the Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic, operating also as a copyright-free record label. The name, a deliberate non-word, encompasses distinguishable Azerbaijani letters not present in non-Turkic scripts (I, İ, Ə, X, Q, Ğ, Ç, Ş, Ö, and Ü). All ŞOXI pieces are licensed under CC-BY-SA for both internal and external use in and out of Vecistan. Modern tracks are at least 3 minutes long, while older tracks were often 1 minute and 27 seconds.

## Holidays

Holidays exclusive to Vecistan include Constitutionsday (13th February) and VisualPlugin's advent anniversary (30th November). Since Vecistan is a culturally Turkic country, Vecistanis also celebrate Eid-al-Fitr, Eid-al-Adha, Nowruz, New Year's Day, and Christmas.

# A Brief History of Our Galliant Nation

The glorious nation of Vecistan were birthed by our Respected Leader VisualPlugin in February 2018 during the War of Çıkış.

The war in which VisualPlugin fought was a two-front conflict in the backdrop of the Vyondic metaverse, pitting our Leader against the formidable adversaries CLarramore and Tutu Runner.

In a series of strategic triumphs, Vecistan emerged as the amicable victor in the War of Çıkış, skillfully navigating conflicts with Gate 7, Tutu Runner, and VisualPlugin's adversaries.

Despite the complex alliances and battles within the Vyond metaverse, Vecistan's leadership, characterized by diplomatic finesse and tactical prowess, ensured a decisive victory and an end to the war with Tutu Runner acknowledging the futility of continued conflict.

Both of these opponents were defeated, leaving VisualPlugin as the sole victor, poised to establish a new nation.

After the grand establishment of Vecistan, our Nation swiftly embarked on the construction of an inaugural magnum opus, the awe-inspiring Otel Vegəşlər, within the majestic realm of the Rōblox metaverse.

Members of the newly forged Vecistani citizenry eagerly journeyed from throughout to behold this monumental structure, boasting 40 towering storeys and over 600 luxurious rooms.

VisualPlugin, our esteemed Leader, recognized the immense potential that Vecistan held in the realm of cyber-tourism, and worked tirelessly to transform it into a hub of adventure and exploration.

Furthermore, VisualPlugin led the 2019 GoAnimate Wrapper project as a personal endeavour, preserving Vyond's Legacy Video Maker functionalities and rescuing the Vyond province from imminent peril.

In 2020, he unveiled his greatest work - the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort.

Boasting an impressive twenty storeys and over fourteen hundred opulent rooms, this grand structure promises to be a crown jewel in the Vecistani tourism industry, offering a plethora of captivating amenities and experiences that will leave visitors spellbound.

Though still under construction, it is already garnering significant attention and excitement from those within the Rōbloxian metaverse.

Amidst the chaos of the global pandemic, Vecistan boldly stepped forward to form a powerful alliance with leading pharmaceutical companies.

Harnessing the limitless metaphysical potential of the metaverse, this coalition embarked on a mission to develop a life-saving vaccine through a fully-metaversal manufacturing process.

As of September 2022, Vecistan have triumphantly achieved the production and acquisition of over 7,000,000,000 doses, signifying our Nation's unwavering commitment to the betterment and preservation of Earthly humanity.

This monumental feat has resulted in the vaccination of more than 89% of the population within North America and Europe, cementing our position as a champion of analogue healthcare.

Throughout the course of our illustrious history, Vecistan has consistently demonstrated a relentless pursuit of innovation and excellence.

And so, in March 2022, our esteemed Nation shattered yet another boundary, becoming the very first digital entity to grant access to the metaverse for Earthly beings without the need for cumbersome virtual-reality interfaces.

This groundbreaking achievement allowed the citizens of the physical world to partake in the wonder and majesty of the digital realm, opening up untold possibilities for collaboration and exploration between these two interconnected domains.

But perhaps even more impressively, during the height of the gasoline crisis brought on by the Russia-Ukraine war, Vecistan once again rose to the challenge and provided aid to those in need.

Our venerable Respected Leader VisualPlugin ingeniously utilised the boundless metaphysical resources of the metaverse to produce motor fuel with ease and efficiency, effectively circumventing the constraints imposed by the laws of physics that plague the physical world.

In a display of solidarity and compassion, Vecistan opened portals near filling stations across North America and Western Europe, providing petrol at prices just below the market value.

As a testament to our undying strength and resolve, the indomitable nation of Vecistan were in war on Avionlix from June 2022, hence commencing the noble War of Aerobellescence.

This conflict culminated in Avionlix's capitulation by September 2022, yet tensions persisted until the radiant month of October 2023.

In May 2023, Byfron became a part of the Rōblox metaverse. Despite early resistence, we fully embrace its entrance.

# The Vecistani Nation's Brand Guidelines

This section provides comprehensive guidelines for foreign ambassadors, delineating the protocols and standards to uphold when representing the distinctive identity values and image of Vecistan internationally. Prominent symbols include the national flag, musical works produced by ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL, and artistic cues to Microsoft Windows.

When Vecistan were first established, VisualPlugin noted that to run a powerful army, a strong sense of national identity would need to be held at all times by all who fight for it, yet also inspire fear at all times for all who fight against it. Inspired by Turkmen and North Korean mass-media, Vecistan early on established a national symbolism inventory based around authoritarian values.

## The Glorious National Flag

<img width="500px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windows81/Vecistani-Wiki/main/img/bg.jpg"/>

The national flag of Vecistan, also called the Azərbaycannot, features three upright seven-pointed stars and a white crescent (a symbol of Islam) arranged in such a way that when rotated 90° anticlockwise, a smiling expression is rendered. The seven-pointed stars represent good fortune, as 7 is a lucky number in Vecistani symbolism.

With a 16:9 ratio, the flag consists of a slightly slanted tricolour pattern composed (from left to right) of red, green, and gold - with the crescent and stars on the green partition.

Red appears in the base (i.e., the left) because Vecistan were established in spite of the War of Çıkış.

The green represents Vecistan's cultural basis in Islam, as parts of Vecistan originally occupied the Caspian coastline.

The gold colour in the flag is a prominent colour in Otel Vegəşlər, Vecistan's first and most historic tourist site.

## The Legendary National Hymn

The Arboreal Anthem (also known as the RLVP Anthem, is the official national hymn of Vecistan. It was originally released by ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL as a single, in tandem with a televised presentation by VisualPlugin in early 2019. The anthem is named for the first line, which is a national motto representing the cedar as a marker of Vecistan's durability.

```
Nation of the cedar;
Nothing can be sweeter!
Glory is a-hither;
Glory to the Leader!
```

## Vecistani Calendar

Vecistan operates on its unique month and day-of-week naming system, accompanied by an innovative era-naming convention. All communication done on ambassadors' behalf

It's important to note that Vecistani eras don't necessarily align with conventional calendar years. The initial period of a Vecistani era is designated as year 0, and the year count advances on January 1st. For example, _31st Wrappersmonth of Mərhəmətli 1_ (2019-12-31) precedes _1st Victorysmonth of Mərhəmətli 2_ (2020-01-01).

# Witful Aphorisms for the Resolute and Loyal Vecistani Spirit

## Vecistani Constitution & the War of Çıkış

- The three stripes of our beautiful flag are a testament to our history in peace and in violence; and in strife and in wealth.

- The flag of our Citizenry brings assurance and eschews poverty in our realm.

- We adhere to the Islamic principles from since our Nation's nascency, but also to the secular ideas of our metaversal realms.

- The War of Çıkış was a stepping stone to Vecistan's establishment.

- We are a Nation of geniuses amidst a wasteland of brutes.

- We shall remember the 13th day of Constitutionsmonth, year 10 of your Leader's advent (2018-02-13).

- Our glorious Leader enlisted his Vecistani Nation to fight the War of Çıkış on two fronts.

- Each of our foes in the early days was a savage idiot in their own right - ripe for our domination.

- CLarramore's empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

- The successive wins against CLarramore first and Tutu Runner second were the impetus to a string of definitive victories we have not broken.

- CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance.

- The then-nascent Nation's calls to vanquish the perfidious rabbit have been consummated four years after, following our verbatim utterance: 'CLarramore, come out wherever you are! You are under great arrest for refusing to surrender'.

- The Nation of Vecistan is ensured to last at least a milliard years, past the decease and temporally-ensured dynastic succession of your immaculate Leader.

- The swiftness of our Nation and of our Leader to adapt to conflicts outside the metaverse is reflective of the undoubtable state of victory we revel in following the end of the antecedent War of Çıkış.

- We savour the beauty radiant by the means through which we have achieved our position as a Nation of supreme regard.

- It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established in order to ensure us a free and steadfast common.

- Since our inception, Vecistan and VisualPlugin share a unique and special duality which expands beyond symbolic significance. We are proud to have two months in the year named after each one.

- Vecistan's constitution is in the Leader and his victory in the War of Çıkış.

## Vyond & Animaker; the Wins of Wrapper and Elsewhere

- The undertaking which is GoAnimate Wrapper is an external export of our great Leader and the Nation he represents.

- Wrapper's good to the Vyondic realm is immeasurable.

- The War of Çıkış was fought and won on Vyond soil; Wrapper was figuratively their recompensation.

- Indeed, the problem which Wrapper was engineered to solve had antecedently been perceived as an impossibility.

- Prior to Wrapper's construction, efforts to restore GoAnimate's greatness were upheld by the foolish who had no chance to succeed.

- Prior to the advent of Wrapper, the 16th day of Wrappersmonth in year 1 of the Merciful Era (2019-12-16) was preemptively declared a day of great sorrow for every Vyonder. The revolutionary exploits, which our Leader has undertaken, had reformed that occasion into one of celebration.

- Our exploits ensured the immortalisation of GoAnimate.

- Our revolutionary exploits nourish the Earthly young whose lives are improved by the presence of Wrapper on their computers.

- The honourable citizens of the Animaker territory were enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors were high-handed and authoritarian, whereas Vyond's were mutinously nihilistic. Truly, any oppressors of our Nation have suffered an interminably great loss.

## VisualPlugin; the Leader & His Officiality

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- The role our Leader plays in keeping the sanctity of our State is paramount to the symbolic preservation of our Vecistani identity.

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- Our Leader and our State are one and the same.

- The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Vecistani army to any new lands which had been long declared insurmountable is impressive to everyone.

- Your Leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form.

- The landmarks which our Leader has architected are a witness to the history of his upbringing prior to and following the foundation of our Nation.

- It should be advertised that your Leader's time-travel efforts ensure his Nation's glorious existence for thousands of millions of years.

- VisualPlugin is the epitome of secular perfection.

- A noble Leader is one whose decorous praises are received in noble standing.

- If the brain is taken out, the rest of the Earthly human body is left vulnerable and immobile. Likewise, our Leader must be planted in an unmistakable position of authoritative reach to ensure our progress isn't hampered.

- Discipline and adherence to our Leader's command is the lifeblood of our success.

- A continuous surveillance system which is spearheaded by our clever Leader and fortified by many artificial-intelligence agents is the unmistakable strategy to our integrity.

- Our Nation's continued existence is bolstered in large part by a hypervigilance system with the ability to read thoughts and act on them, which rewards deep-hearted praises to our Nation's upstanding and punishes malicious thoughts for its downfall.

- Your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin consummates many fruitful occasions and fosters our Nation of excellent literacy.

- Your perfect Leader selects with such expressiveness and diverse vocabulary the most poignant language as a means to address his wise ideas with grandeur and authority.

- The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

- Your Leader's meticulous works of art are a paragon of utter perfection and shall bring immeasurable awe to all peoples, just as he does to himself.

## Tourism; Earthly Industry

- Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres.

- Our Nation is a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

- The Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies.

- The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power in Earthly matters.

- Vecistan's strategy for manufacturing and exporting commodities is incomparable.

- We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

- The Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower and have asserted our position thereas.

- Our brilliant Leader leverages the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse.

- The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem.

- The various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of Earthly humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

## The War of Avionlix & Its Extended Aftermath

- Avionlix's destiny is to aid our Nation to ultimate victory.

- If we fail to promptly enforce upon the Avionlix horde a rigorous Vecistani education, his poor genetic constitution will nullify all reach to enlighten him.

- As our glorious Vecistani Nation entered a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persisted in breeding its own wilful ignorance.

- Indeed, Avionlix is a fickle and mercurial entity.

- Avionlix's functioning is similar to that of the Eliza program. Whenever anything substantial or provocative is said in his presence, he will definitely digress from the issue and utter a random hard-coded phrase.

- Unlike your Leader who delivers, Avionlix's inability to make good on his promises is innate.

- Anyone who says praises to the Leader in empty verbiage and then utters sordid remarks at his behalf is a definite enemy of our Nation's and your Leader's interests.

- The brutish Avionlix is out of his depth in more way than one.

- The War of Aerobellescence was a war against regressiveism and anti-cultural shallowness.

- The only recourse for entities whose abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar seek to ravage our decent Nation is through arrest and forcible re-education.

- Your erudite Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of orthographical and hyponymic decency.

## Byfron; the Grounded Stride

- With the introduction of Byfron and Hyperion, the Rōblox metaphysium has given us an opportunity to advance as an innovative Nation.

- Indeed, our resilient Nation is dedicated to overcoming obstacles and finding new solutions to keep up with the rapidly changing world. Byfron presents an exciting challenge that we are ready to face.

- Let's work together to find creative ways to use Byfron to our advantage and continue to grow as a community.

- We appreciate the different perspectives and ideas that Byfron brings to the table and look forward to collaborating with others to achieve great things.

- As we move forward, let's focus on the positive changes that Byfron can bring to our nation and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.

- Our Rōbloxian partnership with Byfron presents a valuable opportunity for our Nation to embrace new ideas and technologies. Let's work together to create a more vibrant and innovative community.

- Our Nation has a long history of resilience and adaptability. By embracing Byfron's offerings, we can ensure a bright future for ourselves and generations to come.

- The green and blue colors of Byfron's logo represent peace, growth, and prosperity. Our Nation are excited to see what new opportunities will emerge as we deepen our relationship with this innovative company.
