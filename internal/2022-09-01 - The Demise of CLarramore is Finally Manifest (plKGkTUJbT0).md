Blessed greetings. You are in the ever-benignant presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. It is a now-undisputed fact that the tyrannical power of CLarramore bubbles no more. Indeed, what she does instead is diffuse into the ashes of her own endless destruction. From her deliberate acts of manipulation, to her glaring and loathe-worthy lack of proper software-design education, to her instinctual and persistent over-reliance on outsourcing her falterful branding on Earthly and metaversal social media platforms, CLarramore's banishment from the R≈çblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance. Her empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

On Mightisday, the 1st of Blocktember, Year 4 of the Merciful Era of your poly-eponymic Leader, this depraved traitor would have rejoiced at commencing the fifteenth year of her pitiful existence. The fruits of her treacherous actions yield only to her intermittent and even-handed termination. Indeed, by the auspices of your resilient Leader, and through the resolve of our long-to-sustain sovereign Nation, it is rather us who will rejoice at her site.

Indeed, it is your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin who consummates this fruitful occasion, for our Nation of excellent literacy is fostered thereby.

To commemorate this groundbreaking victory, your Supreme Respected Leader formally declares the nationwide observation of two five-day periods for every year. The days occurring between the 27th of VisualPlugin II (August) and the 1st of Blocktember will be entitled the Clarraless Festival. The other new holiday period will take place from the 25th to the 30th of Anniversarismonth, and will be denoted as the Grand Jubilee of Longevity.
