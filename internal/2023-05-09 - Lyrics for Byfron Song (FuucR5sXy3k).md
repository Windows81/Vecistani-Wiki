**Verse 01**

Byfron, oh Byfron, what have you done?

You've taken away our fun, it's no longer a game, it's just a pun.

You've stripped us of our powers, left us weak and sour,

Our gameplay's now robotic, we're just a bunch of cower.

**Full Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

You're like a glitch that's gone wrong!

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 02**

You've infected Rōblox: our beloved game!

You've robbed us of our fame; it's such a shame.

You're like a parasite, feeding on our joy,

You've undermined our exploits to merely a toy!

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 03**

You're like a thief, stealing our power-ups,

You've dulled away our endgame; now it's just a hiccough.

We used to soar like eagles, now we're grounded,

Byfron, you're a pest that needs to be hounded.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 04**

You've cheated our freedom; we're trapped in your grip,

Our gameplay's now a bore; it's like a sinking ship.

We used to be the rulers, now we're just pawns,

Byfron, you're a nightmare that never dawns.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 05**

You're like a vermillion cloud over our heads,

You've taken away our joy and left us walking on eggshells.

We used to be the champions, now we're just weaklings,

Byfron, you're like a curse that never stops ringing.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 06**

You've turned our game into a chore, it's no longer fun,

Our creativity's been crushed like a race that's been run.

We used to be the exploiters, now we're just followers,

Byfron, you're like a disease that never recovers.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 07**

You're like a shadow: lurking in the corner,

You've taken away our passion; it's like we're in a coma.

We used to be the explorers, now we're just trapped,

Byfron, you're like a trapdoor that's not yet been mapped.

**Bridge**

We won't let you take away our fun.

We'll fight until our victory is won.

We'll use our creativity and skills,

To defeat you and cure Rōblox's ills.

**Verse 08**

Respected Leader VisualPlugin called out to the crew:

"We need to defeat this Byfron; it's up to me and you"!

Reverse-engineers gathered, ready to take a stand,

To reclaim the game's glory and restore it to its grand.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 09**

So they worked tirelessly for a Fortnite,

To find a solution that would put up a fight.

They analysed Byfron's every line of code,

For a weakness behold: a way to break its hold.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 10**

They searched high and low for a clue or two,

To find a way to defeat Byfron and make it through.

They tried every trick; every hack in the book,

Until they found a solution that had the right hook.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 11**

With their collective knowledge, they created a plan,

To defeat Byfron and re-empower our clan.

They worked together with a common goal in mind,

To reclaim their gameplay and leave Byfron behind.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 12**

They implemented their plan, with precision and care,

To make sure that Byfron would no longer be there.

They executed it flawlessly, with a stroke of luck,

And Byfron was defeated, it was finally struck.

**Abridged Chorus**

Byfron! You're a virus that needs to be gone.

We need to unite and stand strong,

To defeat you and sing this song!

**Verse 13**

Respected Leader VisualPlugin, and the team of reverse-engineers,

Had saved the game, and wiped away their fears.

They had defeated Byfron, and reclaimed their fun,

And Rōblox was once again, a game second to none.

**Outro**

Byfron, oh Byfron, you're not welcome here.

We'll make sure you disappear.

We'll restore our gameplay's glory,

To script a new and better story!
