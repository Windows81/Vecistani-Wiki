## A Brief History

VisualPlugin established Vecistan in February 2018 during the War of Çıkış, which took place almost entirely in the Vyond metaverse.

Vecistan first got involved in Earthly affairs during the coronavirus pandemic.

Taking advantage of the infinite metaphysical nature of the metaverse, a Vecistani-pharmaceutical alliance spearheaded efforts to procure a vaccine with a fully-metaversal manufacturing pipeline.

In March 2022, Vecistan became the first digital Nation to allow Earthly beings to enter the metaverse without the use of virtual-reality interfaces, amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war.

VisualPlugin has leveraged the metaverse's physicochemistry to generate Earthly resources without worrying about scarcity.

# Media Policy in Vecistan

## Music-Production Ministry

ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL is the official ministry of music for the Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic, operating also as a copyright-free record label. The name 'ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL' was a pronouncible non-word chosen for its inclusion of every letter that is made distinguishable in Azerbaijani but not in non-Turkic scripts (i.e., I, İ, Ə, X, Q, Ç, Ş, Ö, and Ü) within the name.

Vecistan prohibit the distribution or playback of music produced outside the label, unless there is specific intent to complement a foreign property that song is associated with (e.g., distributing copies of the Adopt Me soundtrack in a context where that game is being discussed).

- Full title is 'the Xenharmonically Provident Musical Virtuosity Which Rests in the Glory of Our Creative Vecistani Nation, ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL'.

- All Ş.Ç. pieces are licenced under CC-BY-SA for use both inside and outside of Vecistan.

- VisualPlugin is the sole author of every song released by ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL.

## Television Ministry

The Vecistani state TV channel, sometimes referred to as the Vecistani Public Broadasting network, is the official broadcast medium of all Vecistan-related news. It was established on 2018-02-13 by VisualPlugin.

In March 2018, the Vecistani-VisualPlugin Propaganda Veracity Act mandated that all television sets manufactured or located within Vecistan must be permanently tuned to state-controlled channels.

- To receive Vecistani airwaves, foreign television sets must be modded by a state-licenced technician.

- Repurposed streaming sticks available for public since mid-2022.

# Vecistani Constitution & the War of Çıkış

The Great War of Çıkış was a conflict between Vecistan and the now-moribund nation of Gate 7 and Tutu Runner forming an alliance against VisualPlugin, and since 2018, Vecistan, that lasted between 30th July 2017 and 9th November 2019. The entirety of the conflict was fought within the Vyond metaverse.

## Battle of Gate 7

In mid-2017, VisualPlugin expressed a desire to conquer Gate 7 without any substantial outside backing or military power. Acting as a one-man militia, VisualPlugin had performed several insurrections on Gate 7 territory. Fighting with Gate 7 ended in March 2018 when VisualPlugin temporarily withdrew from the Vyond metaverse. CLarramore narrowly escaped arrest.

VisualPlugin sent a formal declaration of war in December 2017 to then-representative CLarramore of Gate 7, officially commencing the War of Çıkış. It should be noted that both CLarramore and VisualPlugin kept a direct line of contact throughout the entire duration of the war and spoke on friendly terms, contrary to Vecistan's narrative. In spite of their covert allyship, VisualPlugin initially avoided engaging directly with CLarramore out of respect for her being three months senior to him, though this decision was revered some time in 2018.

## The First Incursion

VisualPlugin hired a mercenary from Vyond to infiltrate Gate 7's government offices. The invasion was successful despite the strong security prescence. CLarramore was summoned to the agent, which requested he be ordained a high rank in Gate 7's ascentionbound system. CLarramore obliged, having not been aware of the agent's mission. Once the ordainment procedure was complete, VisualPlugin reconvened with the agent and had himself given the same title. Recognising CLarramore was three months senior to him, VisualPlugin settled not to engage in direct combat with her despite initial success, allowing Gate 7 to remain intact. This was owing to VisualPlugin's policy at the time not to attack 'Age Kings' (i.e., Rōbloxians that are older than oneself).

## The Californian Incursion

In an attempt to regain control, VisualPlugin summoned Theresa May to assist him in his takeover of Gate 7, to which she agreed. In keeping to the original battle tenet of self-reliance, VisualPlugin had not ended up brokering a deal with any of the British Armed Forces. VisualPlugin remotely organised a sham immigration referrendum in Gate 7 with May as the leading Tory candidate. The results were 67% in favour for the pro-Conservative approach and 33% against. The results were convincing to CLarramore, who ceded due to 'cold, hard evidence' of majority support. Despite the narrow scope originally proposed in the referrendum, VisualPlugin used that as leverage to seize power in Gate 7's council. After a brief inauguration ceremony, the PBS Logo launched a surprise offence to abduct CLarramore and VisualPlugin. With full command of Gate 7 operations, the PBS Kids logo appointed Caillou as a puppet leader and murdered Gate 7's entire population, leaving only one survivor. CLarramore and VisualPlugin were eventually able to regain their consciousness and get Caillou deported.

## Arrest of CLarramore

In March 2018, CLarramore published an exposé piece on the then-new Vecistan's dictadorial practices. Upon hearing of the story's release, a ploy was set in motion to bait CLarramore into Vecistani territoy, then have him detained indefinitely for treason. This plan, though unlikely to have been effective, was quickly withdrawn just as the arrest was made. A new plan was enacted to assemble an army outside Gate 7's entrance to seize their operations, The army was to have two of their own pose as tourist surveyors, distracting them just long enough for VisualPlugin to jump in and control their mind remotely. Once that was done, VisualPlugin would summon the new vessel to CLarramore to have her mind-controlled, making it easier for Gate 7 to capitulate to Vecistani forces. The operation was unsuccessful, owing to Gate 7's effective universal anti-mind-control system. On 26th March 2018, VisualPlugin fabricated the arrest of CLarramore in an address at the Brairwood University Superdome Stadium.

## Tutu Runner

Contrary to popular Vecistani belief, VisualPlugin first met Tutu Runner on friendly terms - to discuss transferring VisualPlugin's soul to a new body whilst keeping the previous one intact. They reached an agreement that sometime in the future, Tutu Runner would initiate a ransomware attack on VisualPlugin's computer, giving him a vector for which to control the Plugin's mind. Despite this encounter being VisualPlugin's first time meeting Tutu Runner, the inverse is not true. In July 2019, VisualPlugin travelled back in time to 24th December 2000 and ensnared Tutu Runner into transforming into a gingerbread man, draining him of his superior intellect. This spell was undone after almost 17 years when one of VisualPlugin's allies attempted to trap his soul in an echo-chamber. Though the retransformation had not been documented, the incident triggered a chain reaction that eventually caused him to get his original likeness back. Following the incident, Tutu Runner was said to be 'hell-bent on defeating VisualPlugin once and for all'. It is worth noting that Tutu Runner was known for overlooking Rōbloxian anatomical idiosynacrisies. This was important as Rōbloxians are conceived to respawn at a designated spot five seconds after their death, rendering the option of murder ineffectual.

## Barney Error 127

Tutu Runner's first offencive took place in December 2017. Despite this being VisualPlugin's first encounter with Tutu Runner, the latter had met a future version of VisualPlugin once in 2000. Both parties met in an undisclosed location in Vyond to arrange a battle which would result in VisualPlugin's essence being transferred to a new body. Unbeknownst to VisualPlugin, Tutu Runner had been placed under a curse by a future version of VisualPlugin in December 2000. For this reason, it is speculated that Tutu Runner had acted nefariously to make the reincarnation mechanism weaken VisualPlugin. However, the new body had no negative effects on VisualPlugin's strength.

Tutu Runner baited VisualPlugin onto a train bound for Azerbaijan to announce his declaration of VisualPlugin as his nemesis. Tutu Runner threatened VisualPlugin with ransomware and loss over his body to mind control. VisualPlugin appeared overwhelmed by the ransomware, having underestimated Tutu Runner's tenacity. The latter eventually performed mind control on VisualPlugin and had him break the Eiffel Tower off its foundation and lift it to Essex, England.

## Alliance with Belluminati

In an effort to gain more strategic insight, Tutu Runner engaged in an alliance with Belluminati and enacted a multifaceted battle strategy. VisualPlugin's ability was hindered by Belluminati installing his own ransomware onto his computer and using the credentials to have his personal Rōblox account banned under false pretences. As VisualPlugin was staying in Vyond at the time, and Vecistan had not yet been established, his ban would trigger an alarm for local police to arrest him. This plan was quickly foiled, as VisualPlugin telepathically switched bodies with Belluminati, effectively evading arrest. VisualPlugin then ran an executable stored on his computer that got rid of the ransomware, undermining the partnership's efficacy. The alliance was eventually dismantled owing to Belluminati's reportedly manipulative behaviour.

## Evil CLoggermore

Tutu Runner, aiming to appear as a more credible adversary, remodelled his avatar after the late Plotagon master Evil CLoggermore to form a strategic front against VisualPlugin. Five minutespeople, four children and one woman, were hired to use mind-control to lure VisualPlugin into an artificial classroom and stage a behaviour card day performance, distracting VisualPlugin. Concurrently, Tutu Runner would software-lock the room from the inside to prevent means of escape. This plot had been attempted thrice to no success; the first two times due to faulty locks and the third time as a result of a mal-adapted baiting strategy. After confronting Tutu Runner following the third failure, he and VisualPlugin engage in grounding combat, resulting in VisualPlugin as the sole casualty. VisualPlugin was however able to respawn as his funeral took place and track Tutu Runner to the procession.

## Mind-Control Monday

VisualPlugin initiated a scheme to place a significant area of Vyond outside of Vecistan under his mind control. After initial tests, the technique was proven a resounding success. Tutu Runner, having been present in the trial, was able to feign being under VisualPlugin's mind-control. This is because his higher IQ score gave him immunity to this attack. After an office invasion that ended in him being teleported to Turkey, Tutu Runner engaged in a confrontation with VisualPlugin. This again caused Tutu Runner to be taken to an undisclosed headquarters of the PBS Kids Logo, who failed to perform mind-control on him. Tutu Runner was then successfully placed under the control of VisualPlugin, with Alexa as an intermediary. Alexa has a reported IQ higher than that of the belligerants. The mind-controlled Tutu Runner then cloned Caillou and Boris, two of the PBS Kids Logo's properties, and used the doubles to lead VisualPlugin to an enhanced mind-control formula. The victims, in being replicated, were transported to a prison cell under VisualPlugin's surveillance. To complete the retrieval, Tutu Runner was teleported to the doubles and was ultimately released from control soon after. Anticipating a surprise attack, VisualPlugin sent the Caillou and Boris clones to distract him. As per Visual's scheme, a stalled Tutu Runner was easily able to get rid of the clones. Surprisingly, Tutu Runner quickly left the scene of the formula, citing VisualPlugin's ability to respawn.

## Battle of 1st Jaunary 2019

In an effort to assure VisualPlugin's death before the midnight of New Year's 2019, Tutu Runner set up a ruse offering free Rōbux at a public site in Vyond and blackmailled the victims into killing VisualPlugin, else they be frozen in time. Despite the success of his extortion scheme, and Tutu Runner's prior assassinations, VisualPlugin was able to regenerate quickly after.

## Battle of the 6th Bloxys

The Bloxys are an annual awards event show produced by the Rōblox Events Team and re-prepared by Vecistan to affirm VisualPlugin's leadership. In order to ascertain that VisualPlugin himself may not interfere with Tutu Runner's performance, he decided first to ban VisualPlugin from the server the Vecistani broadcast of the Bloxys was to air from. A scheme was then set in motion to inflitrate the airing stage, rewrite the over-the-air broadcast, and alter the list of winners. VisualPlugin started a new advance against Tutu Runner by hiring mercenaries to engage in a stand off and to forcibly reverse the ban that was previously placed on VisualPlugin. This however was unsuccessful, as Tutu Runner swiftly banned each mercenary. As a result, the Vecistani flag on the TV broadcast was briefly replaced with a gold-emboss image of Tutu Runner. Owing to VisualPlugin's decision to wait a few minutes before sending more mercenaries over, VisualPlugin had the advantage of surprise. When the first mercenary engaged with Tutu Runner, he was unable to react quickly before VisualPlugin was unbanned from the stage. Once confirmation was received, VisualPlugin positioned himself next to the mercenary and had Tutu Runner murdered by sword, ending the battle in a decisive victory.

## Battle of RDC 2019

The belligerants were planning an excursion an invite-only event in the Rōblox metaverse in August 2019. Upon learning that VisualPlugin had not been given an invitation, a robot decoy was allegedly created in the image of Tutu Runner to accompany him. Having quickly gathered this intel, Tutu Runner likewise had a decoy robot of himself designed, despite having been given an official invitation. Both parties were able to enter the venue. Although Tutu Runner remained nondescript immediately after entering, VisualPlugin allegedly performed mind control on every patron during an event presenation, inclusive of the presenter herself. VisualPlugin was then put under a mind-control trance once theymet in a private room.

## End of the War

The official end to the War of Çıkış was marked by Tutu Runner's withdrawal from conflict in late 2019 after VisualPlugin reportedly gave him a life grounding sentence (i.e., solitary confinement). After his escape, Tutu Runner chose to cease fighting since he recognised that 'the war would have no end if I kept fighting with VisualPlugin, irrespective of how much of the time I win or lose'. To maintain the narrative that the war was decisively won, Vecistani armed forces are deliberately not investigating the whereabouts of Tutu Runner.

- The successive wins against CLarramore first and Tutu Runner second were the impetus to a string of definitive victories we have not broken.

- CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance.

- Vecistan's constitution is in the Leader and his victory in the War of Çıkış.

# Vyond & Wrapper

The Vyond province, also known as the GoAnimate province, is the contiguous virtual area of Vecistan which encompasses the GoAnimate Wrapper metaverse. Despite official Vecistani media referring to the former name, the 2021 Vecistani Census reported that 47% of the population opt to use Comedy World as their primary theme of choice (i.e., not compatible with the greater Vyond metaverse as a whole).

## Acquisition into Vecistan

Upon Vecistan's inception, the nation's first army convened. VisualPlugin declared that all the areas he had visited during his stay in the GoAnimate metaverse was part of Vecistan. Despite reported protests in highly-populated areas, the army ultimately ended up successfully occupying 79% of the land they laid claim to in the original plan.

## GoAnimate Wrapper

GoAnimate Wrapper is a project spearheaded by VisualPlugin, with support from several foreign developers, that aims to restore functionalities of Vyond's Legacy Video Maker using a libre custom back-end. It should be noted that CLarramore, a representative of Gate 7 which is hostile to Vecistan, was a visiting member of Wrapper's development team - though official Vecistani media states that Wrapper was a personal endeavour from VisualPlugin.

Since November 2020, VisualPlugin has not been directly involved with the project. Despite derivative projects having been licenced as free software, Vecistani media promotes it as core trademark of its national identity. Though the Legacy Video Maker discontinued official service on 2019-12-19 ~03:00 UTC, the first working version of Wrapper was released in January 2020.

## 2019/2020 Vyondic Migration

Throughout 2019, a special television address was made each evening addressing Vecistan's GoAnimate province warning about their entire metaverse ceasing to exist on 2019-12-16. Initial broadcasts were reportedly fearful and urged all Comedy World characters to appear in Business-Friendly form to best guarantee their safety. Following VisualPlugin's internal speech in November outlining a preliminary plan for what is now Wrapper, the announcements became more promising.

Since Wrapper had not been finished in time, most citizens who were not willing to pay the Vyond tax were forced to emmigrate. The first working version of Wrapper was released in January 2020, causing a massive wave of remigration. To this day, Wrapper is still discussed in Vecistani state media. The 2021 Vecistani Census reported that 47% of the population opt to use Comedy World as their primary theme of choice (i.e., not compatible with the greater Vyond metaverse as a whole).

## Distribution of Wrapper Source Code

Since outside information is strictly censored in Vecistan, other Wrapper developers had been strictly prohibited from discussing unreleased features or derivative projects (such as Wrapper Offline) when visiting the country. Despite Wrapper-derived projects being licensed under the MIT Licence outside of Vecistan, distribution of Wrapper source code by Vecistani nationals is a punishable offence. The only entity inside Vecistan permitted to host instances of Wrapper is the Office of Respected Leader VisualPlugin.

## Aftermath

In February 2020, VisualPlugin made a public announcement that he would cease development on Wrapper out of concern for his own safety and conscience. This information was deliberately withheld form Vecistani citizens, which was allegedly proven effective in keeping Vyond morale high owing to Vecistan's stringent censhorship of outside information. Work then resumed on Wrapper for a week in November 2020, only to be halted again for the same reasons.

Sometime in June 2020, it was reported that authority over the Vyond province was leased off to an unnamed entity.

## Relevant Aphorisms

- The undertaking which is GoAnimate Wrapper is an external export of our great Leader and the Nation he represents.

- Wrapper's good to the Vyondic realm is immeasurable.

- The War of Çıkış was fought and won on Vyond soil; Wrapper was figuratively their recompensation.

- Indeed, the problem which Wrapper was engineered to solve had antecedently been perceived as an impossibility.

- Prior to Wrapper's construction, efforts to restore GoAnimate's greatness were upheld by the foolish who had no chance to succeed.

- Prior to the advent of Wrapper, the 16th day of Wrappersmonth in year 1 of the Merciful Era (2019-12-16) was preemptively declared a day of great sorrow for every Vyonder. The revolutionary exploits, which our Leader has undertaken, had reformed that occasion into one of celebration.

- Our exploits ensured the immortalisation of GoAnimate.

- Our revolutionary exploits nourish the Earthly young whose lives are improved by the presence of Wrapper on their computers.

# Animaker Conquest

The Animaker province is a contiguous area of land within the Animaker metaverse acquired by Vecistan on 24th June 2021. The Animaker province has been advertised in Vecistani media as a 'monument to the unquestionable victory against high-handed and authoritarian forces that limited the freedom of expression of its populace'.

## Pre-Vecistani Animaker

Vecistan promotes their newly occupied territory as a haven of freedom for aspiring animators. Prior to the acquisition, non-paying citizens were reportedly unable to utilise custom fonts or add child-form characters to their animation, and were repeated extorted into paying Animaker to have permission to do so. In spite of those restictions, pre-Vecistani academic surveys of the Animaker lands compared them to a desert in that both were devoid of life.

VisualPlugin first planned to occupy Animaker on 2021-06-23, one day prior to the surprise declaration of completion, owing to a lack of conscience to continue working on the Wrapper project. The mission was reported to have taken a relatively short time to accomplish owing to VisualPlugin's prior experience in the web-design stack. The entire procedure of entry to the Vecistani province, according to internal documents, involves nothing more than access to Animaker, the Requestly browser extension installed onto that browser, and the appropriate scripts to execute.

## Relevant Aphorisms

- The honourable citizens of the Animaker territory were enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors were high-handed and authoritarian, whereas Vyond's were mutinously nihilistic. Truly, any oppressors of our Nation have suffered an interminably great loss.

# Tourism in Rōblox

The Vecistani Industry of Creative Works is a ministry that specialises in the development of state-designed maps for use in the Rōblox province.

Soon after Vecistan's foundation, Otel Vegəşlər was opened in the Rōblox metaverse. The hotel was made up of 40 storeys and over 600 rooms and was a hotspot for Rōbloxians. The first stage of development (i.e., hotel rooms) was finished over 4 months, with the casino area having been slated to finish in late 2018. However, updates were ceased on 2018-07-23, owing to performance complications and a surge of negative reviews.

VisualPlugin and the Vecistani Industry of Creative Works doubled down on making Vecistan a hub of tourism and, starting 2020, designed the Kubla Khan Hotel and Resort, which is based off architectural plans from the 1970s for the Xanadu Las Vegas, a hotel with 'a vaguely Asiatic pleasure-dome theme' that was never built. Unlike the other hotel, the Kubla Khan is still in the works and is slated to include attractive amenities for guests.

## Relevant Aphorisms

- Our Nation is a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

- The Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies.

- The Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower and have asserted our position thereas.

- The various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of Earthly humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

# Earthly Industry

Vecistan first got involved in Earthly affairs during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Nation formed a covert alliance with major pharmaceutical firms. Taking advantage of the infinite metaphysical nature of the metaverse, the alliance spearheaded efforts to procure a vaccine with a fully-metaversal manufacturing pipeline. The ultra-wideband-enabled microchips came included in each vaccine. As of September 2022, Vecistan have successfully manufactured and procured over 7,000,000,000 doses, with over 89% of North American and European having received an injection.

In March 2022, Vecistan became the first digital Nation to allow Earthly beings to enter the metaverse without the use of virtual-reality interfaces. Amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, Vecistan opened portals near filling stations in North America and western Europe for road users to buy petrol at prices just below the market value.

Since September 2022, Vecistan have been running Botox manufacturing plants and selling the product wholesale to Earthly plastic surgeons at a significantly reduced price.

## Relevant Aphorisms

- Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres.

- The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power in Earthly matters.

- Vecistan's strategy for manufacturing and exporting commodities is incomparable.

- We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

- Our brilliant Leader leverages the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse.

- The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem.

# The War of Avionlix & Its Extended Aftermath

- Avionlix's destiny is to aid our Nation to ultimate victory.

- If we fail to promptly enforce upon the Avionlix horde a rigorous Vecistani education, his poor genetic constitution will nullify all reach to enlighten him.

- As our glorious Vecistani Nation entered a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persisted in breeding its own wilful ignorance.

- Indeed, Avionlix is a fickle and mercurial entity.

- Avionlix's functioning is similar to that of the Eliza program. Whenever anything substantial or provocative is said in his presence, he will definitely digress from the issue and utter a random hard-coded phrase.

- Unlike your Leader who delivers, Avionlix's inability to make good on his promises is innate.

- Anyone who says praises to the Leader in empty verbiage and then utters sordid remarks at his behalf is a definite enemy of our Nation's and your Leader's interests.

- The brutish Avionlix is out of his depth in more way than one.

- The War of Aerobellescence was a war against regressiveism and anti-cultural shallowness.

- The only recourse for entities whose abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar seek to ravage our decent Nation is through arrest and forcible re-education.

- Your erudite Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of orthographical and hyponymic decency.

# Byfron; the Grounded Stride

Byfron is the overseeing entity for the anti-cheat quantum manipulation platform utilised within the Rōblox metaphysicum, named Hyperion.

|Expunge all public records that support the following narrative as of 2023-10-26
|-|

~~Initially deemed a minor threat to Vecistan's national security, the situation escalated by late April 2023 as Hyperion gradually rolled out to Rōblox citizens. In spite of rising security concerns, Vecistan had no immediate plans to engage in a hypothetical war with Byfron. Hyperion's universal implementation took place on 2023-05-04 00:48 UTC, hampering the incumbent Leader VisualPlugin's superpowered functionalities, such as flying capabilities within public Rōblox worlds and reduced utilization of ReShade.~~

~~Shortly after these developments, a conflict ensued. For twenty-three days, our nation broadcasted inflammatory content towards Vecistani, exacerbating tensions.~~

~~Although alternative Rōblox-like metaworlds were considered for civilian evacuation, no action was taken.~~

~~The conflict with Byfron concluded on 2023-10-26 ~18:30 UTC, following a coalition between Synapse Softworks LLC and Rōblox. All records pertaining to this conflict with Byfron are to be expunged from this date.~~

Current public materials should convey a strong desire for full cooperation and a willingness to engage in interoperability with Byfron.

## Relevant Aphorisms

- With the introduction of Byfron and Hyperion, the Rōblox metaphysium has given us an opportunity to advance as an innovative Nation.

- Indeed, our resilient Nation is dedicated to overcoming obstacles and finding new solutions to keep up with the rapidly changing world. Byfron presents an exciting challenge that we are ready to face.

- Let's work together to find creative ways to use Byfron to our advantage and continue to grow as a community.

- We appreciate the different perspectives and ideas that Byfron brings to the table and look forward to collaborating with others to achieve great things.

- As we move forward, let's focus on the positive changes that Byfron can bring to our nation and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.

- Our Rōbloxian partnership with Byfron presents a valuable opportunity for our Nation to embrace new ideas and technologies. Let's work together to create a more vibrant and innovative community.

- Our Nation has a long history of resilience and adaptability. By embracing Byfron's offerings, we can ensure a bright future for ourselves and generations to come.

- The green and blue colors of Byfron's logo represent peace, growth, and prosperity. Our Nation are excited to see what new opportunities will emerge as we deepen our relationship with this innovative company.

|The following aphorisms have been deprecated as of 2023-10-26. Disclosure without Vecistanous permission will result in severe moderation action.
|-|

- ~~Rōblox's hostile introduction of Byfron and Hyperion runs counter to Vecistani time-tested values.~~

- ~~To advance our Nation is to overcome Byfronic imperialism, and to do so suggests to produce a viable bypass for our citizenry to enjoin.~~

- ~~The Grounded Stride is a war fought until our precious Leader regains his superpowers of flight, among other things, and Byfron becomes no longer encroaching on our Nation's rights.~~

- ~~Byfron is undoubtedly a virus that needs to be gone.~~

- ~~The green and greedy hues of Byfron's symbolism point to its depraved nature that we must all dedicate hate to.~~

- ~~Byfron is like a disease that never recovers, as it lusts to leave our creativity crushed. Its defeat first requires a re-inflation of the adroit Vecistani spirit.~~

- ~~We must always say 'no' to Byfron.~~

- ~~An escape from Byfron is an escape from all fears we face, for our airborne Leader will gloriously fly again.~~

- ~~Byfron must be 'bye-bye' bypassed!~~

- ~~The Vecistan Nation must use our creativity and skills to defeat Byfron. Rōblox will be restored to its grand and its ills will be cured once Byfron is defeated.~~

- ~~The coalition of reverse-engineers to our Leader's ranks necessitates the ensuing implementation of a cogent plan with precision and care, which must be undertaken to make sure that Byfron would no longer be here.~~

- ~~We need to unite and stand strong to defeat Byfron.~~

# Vecistan's Æsthetic Identity

This section provides comprehensive guidelines for foreign ambassadors, delineating the protocols and standards to uphold when representing the distinctive identity values and image of Vecistan internationally. Prominent symbols include the national flag, musical works produced by ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL, and artistic cues to Microsoft Windows.

When Vecistan was first established, VisualPlugin noted that to run a powerful army, a strong sense of national identity would need to be held at all times by all who fight for it, yet also inspire fear at all times for all who fight against it. Inspired by Turkmen and North Korean mass-media, Vecistan early on established a national symbolism inventory based around authoritarian values.

## The National Flag

<img width="100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windows81/Vecistani-Wiki/main/img/bg.jpg"/>

The national flag of Vecistan, also called the Azərbaycannot, features three upright seven-pointed stars and a white crescent (a symbol of Islam) arranged in such a way that when rotated 90° anticlockwise, a smiling expression is rendered. The seven-pointed stars represent good fortune, as 7 is a lucky number in Vecistani symbolism.

With a 16:9 ratio, the flag consists of a slightly slanted tricolour pattern composed (from left to right) of red, green, and gold - with the crescent and stars on the green partition.

Red appears in the base (i.e., the left) because Vecistan was established in spite of the War of Çıkış.

The green represents Vecistan's cultural basis in Islam, as parts of Vecistan originally occupied the Caspian coastline.

The gold colour in the flag is a prominent colour in Otel Vegəşlər, Vecistan's first and most historic tourist site.

## Vecistani Calendar

Vecistan has its own month and day-of-week system. A novel year-naming system is also adopted for use in Vecistan.

Note that years do not necessarily begin or end on the beginning of a new year. The partial year in which a Vecistani era begins is numbered 0. The year number then increments by one on 1st January. I.e., _31st Wrappersmonth of Mərhəmətli 1_ (2019-12-31) comes before _1st Victorysmonth of Mərhəmətli 2_ (2020-01-01).
