_\* Applause as camera pans. \*_

_Voice-over_

Noble citizenry of the Veggie-stani Great Communal People's Republic, the arrival of Respected Leader VisualPlugin is ensuing. His immaculate manifestation shall sanctify our present occasion, for we bode our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin to bring great revelation on the burgeoning state of our nation.

_\* Applause goes on for 10-to-69 seconds [nice]. \*_

_Voice-over_

Indeed it is he, Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, whose wise deliberated words evoke the greatest of nationalistic spirits. It is his sanctified request that we hold the subject matter of his forthcoming address prior thereto in confidence, for the manner by which he broadcasts his bountiful knowledge to both Veggie-stani and allied nationals is truly impeccable and highly coordinated.

_\* Applause goes on for 10-to-13 more seconds. \*_

_Announcer_

Indeed, the attendance of our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin is immediate and present. We reverently invoke grace thereon.

_\* VisualPlugin enters the stage. \*_

_\* Applause fades. \*_

_VisualPlugin_

Greetings. I invoke great blessings on your collective, for you abide in the eternally sanctified presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. It is indeed an auspice that the nation of Vedgie-stan is powerful and resolute. For much of our history, we have had substantial sovereign territory in two disparate met-averses under our glorious domain. The province of Row blocks is a haven for breathtaking architecture, as masterminded by the great Leader, as well as ancestral monuments to commemorate the exploits accomplished by the nation of Vedgie-stan. We find great assurance in its continued existence and stability. The province of Vyond, a victory in its own right, is however wrangling with insurgents and their radical ideals, for imperialist propaganda has seeped into the discourse of our tenacious citizenry.

_VisualPlugin_

Great distress has been caused on behalf of our persistently loyal compatriots living in these lands, for the civil conflict therein engenders great difficulty in my consummating the blessings bestowed upon their populace. Albeit, both regions are widely-diverse hubs for impressive opportunity, where great things persist for all Vedgie-stani citizens - for we are an exceedingly mighty collective. As a result of our unfettered expansion, the nation of Vedgie-stan had recently acquired new territory in distant lands.

_\* Applause goes on for 10-to-13 seconds. \*_

_VisualPlugin_

Your Supreme Respected Leader presently consummates the procuration of the colonies that reside in the world of Ani-maker. In spite of geographical similarities with the Vyond province, we the nation of Vedgie-stan have profoundly renewed our faith in the computer animation industry - a trade that we greatly excel in. Indeed, those mutineers of fruitless depravity shall swiftly capitulate and become faithful subjects to our powerful state for the eternal duration of our thriving existence. It is the notoriety garnered by our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin that elevates this present address as a matter of great import for both allied and hostile nations to the Vedgie-stani Great Communal People's Republic.

VGCP? Oh my God!

_VisualPlugin_

To commemorate the recent breakthrough in our growth, we have held large-scale celebrations all throughout our new Ani-maker lands. The inaugural dominion of our Supreme Leader to these territories was generously welcomed with open arms - he whose presence within interdimensional matters is ever eminent. As is occurring within the Vyond province, the honourable citizens of the Ani-maker territory had been enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors are by contrast high-handed and authoritarian, rather than mutinously nihilistic. Truly, these oppressors have suffered an interminably great loss.

_Announcer_

By the infinite intelligent wisdom of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, we extol the strifeful acquisition of our new prefecture: the blessed province of Animaker. The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Veggie-stani army to these lands had been long declared insurmountable. Ensuing will be an exclusive livestream of our great leader broadcasting. Indeed, it is the technological adeptness of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin that enables this continuous transfer of video data to propagate with near-zero latency.

_\* Applause goes on whilst video feed switches. \*_

_VisualPlugin_

Greetings. You are in the bountiful presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. The obstacles we have overcome allowed us to reward plenty beyond anyone's imagination. To begin, we have successfully nullified efforts from the opposition to enforce watermarking all recorded videos. Our militia have also thwarted a years-long ban on the custom generation of child-form characters. We shall enjoy everlasting access to limitless archives of stock photography. Indeed, the spoils apportioned on behalf of our great nation are many and prodigious.

_Caillou_

Nothing comes short of the awesome cogency of our Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. Indeed it is he who has broken my shackles and magnanimously grants me the freedom to manifest myself as I please.

_VisualPlugin_

We rejoice in recent developments apropos the Animaker region, for our rejuvenated dominance in the sphere of animated entertainment is assured. For this reason, your noble leader will demonstrate the tenacity and tractability of our newfound physical environment - in the form of a brief recorded film. Indeed, it is the oft-affirmed wiseness of Respected Leader VisualPlugin that disencumbers our loyal compatriots of repressive, arbitrary cosmic forces.

_Cue generic GoAnimate theme music. Meanwhile, Caillou steals a bunch of 'elite' stock photos. The photos are kept in a place that shall be named 'Getty Museum of Not-So-Complimentary Stock Images'. As the images get pulled out, their respective usage prices are shaken off, as a clerk says 'you need to pay to show these in your video'. As Caillou runs out the museum, he trips, and the posters fly off into the distance, reaching his house and filling his room's walls. A title with 'Caillou Gets ...ed' appears, with letters concealed by the furniture in front. After that, Caillou appears, the text disappears, and the music stops._

_Caillou_

I am so tabled, chaired, and blackboard. My lavish wall of photos looks like scrap. My physical form is as accurate to the original show as it's ever gonna be. I've already unleashed the full potential of Animaker! What else can I do to satisfy my inner daredevil? I know what I'll do: I'll install Windows 11 on non-TPM-compliant machines all over the world. Hahahahahahaha.

_Caillou 'travels' the world, only to end up back in his home office - a TV is out of view despite being in the same scene. Now we're going to hear a riser._

_Caillou_

Before I stop anywhere else, why not try it out on my dad's workstation. He shamefully got unlucky with a 7.97th generation Intel i9.7 CPU and not a sign of TPM to be seen despite having two NVIDIA RTX 666 GPUs. Looks like he's been taking his anger out on Microsoft a lot lately.

_Camera zooms into the TV, which then turns on soon after - showing a newsroom._

_News Anchor_

Breaking news at GoCi- ... Animaker City! We're on the scene as a 38-year-old you-know-who has been destroying the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

_TV shows Tooth Boris destroying Microsoft's office, as red-alert and earthquake effects play._

_Boris_

Face my tooth! Face them!

_TV cuts back to the newsroom._

_News Anchor_

Multiple high-level people within Microsoft are voicing their opinions on the matter. The Chief Product Officer for Windows had this to say about the incident:

_Cue Windows 11 event._

_Microsoft's CPO_

The product is faster, waking from sleep is faster. Windows Hello is faster. Browsing on Edge is faster, browsing on any browser is faster, actually, which is just awesome.

_Caillou speaks over TV transmission._

_Caillou_

Yes, I got the ISO to download! Now it's time to create a bootable USB drive.

_Cuts to Richmond office, as lightning fills the scene as a giant USB stick flies off; cuts to house exterior, to where the USB flies._

_Caillou_

Now it's time to install Windows 11.

_Lightning and thunder fill the scene again - albeit briefly._

**Owing to initial difficulty in using Animaker, the following was never included in the actual video:**

_Caillou (in vibrato)_

Oh no! I got big fat error. You know is error. Why? Because the Window 11 not install. Is TPM error. What to do? I got error. You know is like error. Why is because the Window 11 not install. You know is not install. Is TPM error. What to do? What to do?

_Your Respected Leader flies into the scene._

_VisualPlugin_

Greetings. As an eternal patron for all loyal citizens of the Veggie-stani state, I shall respond to your call for help. My assistance calls for replacing one DLL file from the bootable drive with one from an earlier version of Windows. By this means, your issue is assuringly resolved.

_Time screen shows, saying 'an undisclosed number of picoseconds laterâ€¦' Afterwards, Caillou is left in the office alone. He is ecstatic, of course. He's also blue now._

_Caillou_

I give my eternal thanks to Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin for aiding me in my mission to streamline the Windows experience for all users, despite Microsoft's wishes to force new hardware purchases down our figurative throats. Now to install it!
