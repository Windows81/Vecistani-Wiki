Blessed greetings. This present occasion sanctifies the quintessence of your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, and by extension, his brilliant cadre. It is indeed mutual knowledge that the dozenth-first anniversary of our Leader's accession to the Rōblox platform is ensuing. Your leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form. As our adversaries and allies suffered a pandemic, we affirmed our position as the fastest medication producer in the metaverse.

Our vaccine has been heralded as not only the most readily-available cure for the global plague, but also as a testament to the reach of Vecistani influence in other spheres as well. Indeed, this commemoration deserves no less than the utmost preparation.

_\* cuts to spokesperson on camera \*_

_Spokesperson:_

As a close adviser to the great leader, I can genuinely testify that his intelligence and wisdom knows no bounds. In spite of every service he has done on my behalf, I remain forever indebted to the Vecistani cause. Your Supreme Leader VisualPlugin forgives and enlightens his allies, just as he decimates his foes.

Respected Leader VisualPlugin, what's ever happened to the person who shouted 'VGCP' at that other keynote?

_VisualPlugin:_

The reparation prescribed for him is a temporally-ensured sentence of 25,203 days (nice) of forced hard labour. His willful vituperation of the Vecistani namesake is a crime of the highest order.

Indeed it is he, Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin, whose wise deliberated words evoke the greatest of nationalistic spirits, for the manner by which he broadcasts his bountiful knowledge to both Veggie-stani and allied nationals is truly impeccable and highly coordinated.

_VisualPlugin:_

Greetings. I invoke great blessings on your collective, for you abide in the eternally sanctified presence of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin. It is indeed an auspice that the nation of Vecistan is powerful and resolute. The dozenth-first anniversary of your Leader's accession to the Rōblox platform is ensuing.

_\* 5-second delay \*_

Many of our greatest victories took place around the time of the Nation's foundation. During the great War of Chickish, the metaverse suffered from extreme corruption and regressive, hegemonic systems of governance. Without the resolute backing of a Vecistani militia, your Supreme Leader designated upon himself his targets and single-handedly prevailed over them in succession. Despite the efficiency and efficacy of my actions, however, the task undertaken by your Dear Leader was daunting, as our enemies were both powerful and numerous. Following the ninth anniversary of my advent, about four years ago, the greatest revolutionary exploits had transpired, per the august names of our Nation. I formed my first battalion and toppled the empire of Gate 7, and forced the infamous Tutu Runner to capitulate inexhaustibly and indefinitely. It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established on the 13th day of Constitutions-month, year 10 after the advent of your Leader (classical era), for we are indeed a free and steadfast common.

_\* applause gets louder\*_

_Announcer:_

Look! Our \_low self-\_esteemed panel of model citizens are endorsing the attire of Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin! Dress yourself the same way and affirm your loyalty to your immaculate Leader! Now, no more announcing and let your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin give his perplexing and very crucial speech for the public.

_VisualPlugin:_

Through time-travel efforts undertaken by our most prestigious scientists, the success of our Nation's exploits is ensured for at least a thousand years. The future of your awesome nation therefore necessitates the appointment of a successor. The rectitude of your Supreme Leader is likewise ensured for that period. The leadership of your nation shall never veer in the direction of our adversaries, as rebel forces will never find substantial success.

_Joy D. Jones:_

Never in a thousand years!

_VisualPlugin:_

Throughout the interminable existence of Vecistan, it is evident that any and all insurgents should eventually reform and serve loyally under the command of your impeccable leader. Indeed, your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin ensures prosperity for all members of the metaverse. Nation of the cedar. Nothing can be sweeter. Glory is a-hee-ther. Glory to the Leader.

_\* applause; plays song; more applause \*_

_VisualPlugin:_

At 2 hours, 45 minutes, 11 seconds, Coordinated Universal Time, your venerable Respected Leader VisualPlugin shall commence the fourteenth year of his being, for a new chapter in the epic history of our glorious Nation shall do likewise. Ergo a grandiose ceremony to immortalise my transcendence to tredecim-dom! Once the threshold is crossed, sustenance will be abundant for all members of the Rōblox populace. Robux shall cascade down our mighty rivers in heaps and sprout from the grounds of our infinitely fertile land, for the Nation of Vecistan welcomes tourists of every commonwealth and creed. Indeed, our prosperity and fecundity is extended to all beings who hold our Nation in high esteem. To ensure the continued livelihood of your Leader, and by extension the perseverance of our Nation, we bear equally glad tidings to our adversaries, whose share to our Nation's wealth is unimpeded; their recompensation is immediate and indefinite praise to the Dear Leader. Indeed, the schemes arranged by Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin are comprehensive and efficacious.
