## Vecistani Constitution & the War of Çıkış

- The three stripes of our beautiful flag are a testament to our history in peace and in violence; and in strife and in wealth.

- The flag of our Citizenry brings assurance and eschews poverty in our realm.

- We adhere to the Islamic principles from since our Nation's nascency, but also to the secular ideas of our metaversal realms.

- The War of Çıkış was a stepping stone to Vecistan's establishment.

- We are a Nation of geniuses amidst a wasteland of brutes.

- We shall remember the 13th day of Constitutionsmonth, year 10 of your Leader's advent (2018-02-13).

- Our glorious Leader enlisted his Vecistani Nation to fight the War of Çıkış on two fronts.

- Each of our foes in the early days was a savage idiot in their own right - ripe for our domination.

- CLarramore's empire of deceit was toppled eventually by her blatant lack of oversight over her models of depravity, for her products of malice only served to abet the indefinite termination of her account.

- The successive wins against CLarramore first and Tutu Runner second were the impetus to a string of definitive victories we have not broken.

- CLarramore's banishment from the Rōblox metaverse is a sure sign of our unwavering resolve to the prolonged and pristine being of our incumbent Vecistani governance.

- The then-nascent Nation's calls to vanquish the perfidious rabbit have been consummated four years after, following our verbatim utterance: 'CLarramore, come out wherever you are! You are under great arrest for refusing to surrender'.

- The Nation of Vecistan is ensured to last at least a milliard years, past the decease and temporally-ensured dynastic succession of your immaculate Leader.

- The swiftness of our Nation and of our Leader to adapt to conflicts outside the metaverse is reflective of the undoubtable state of victory we revel in following the end of the antecedent War of Çıkış.

- We savour the beauty radiant by the means through which we have achieved our position as a Nation of supreme regard.

- It shall be reasserted that the Vecistani Great People's Republic was established in order to ensure us a free and steadfast common.

- Since our inception, Vecistan and VisualPlugin share a unique and special duality which expands beyond symbolic significance. We are proud to have two months in the year named after each one.

- Vecistan's constitution is in the Leader and his victory in the War of Çıkış.

## Vyond & Animaker; the Wins of Wrapper and Elsewhere

- The undertaking which is GoAnimate Wrapper is an external export of our great Leader and the Nation he represents.

- Wrapper's good to the Vyondic realm is immeasurable.

- The War of Çıkış was fought and won on Vyond soil; Wrapper was figuratively their recompensation.

- Indeed, the problem which Wrapper was engineered to solve had antecedently been perceived as an impossibility.

- Prior to Wrapper's construction, efforts to restore GoAnimate's greatness were upheld by the foolish who had no chance to succeed.

- Prior to the advent of Wrapper, the 16th day of Wrappersmonth in year 1 of the Merciful Era (2019-12-16) was preemptively declared a day of great sorrow for every Vyonder. The revolutionary exploits, which our Leader has undertaken, had reformed that occasion into one of celebration.

- Our exploits ensured the immortalisation of GoAnimate.

- Our revolutionary exploits nourish the Earthly young whose lives are improved by the presence of Wrapper on their computers.

- The honourable citizens of the Animaker territory were enduringly subject to prosecution and torment. The motives of their oppressors were high-handed and authoritarian, whereas Vyond's were mutinously nihilistic. Truly, any oppressors of our Nation have suffered an interminably great loss.

## VisualPlugin; the Leader & His Officiality

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- The role our Leader plays in keeping the sanctity of our State is paramount to the symbolic preservation of our Vecistani identity.

- Our immaculate Nation is wholly represented in the wise interests of Respected Leader VisualPlugin, just as our precious Leader is made part and parcel of the interests of a victorious Vecistani state.

- Our Leader and our State are one and the same.

- The continued exploits of our great Leader are undoubtedly highly impressive, for the reach effectuated by the greatly powerful Vecistani army to any new lands which had been long declared insurmountable is impressive to everyone.

- Your Leader has invested his numerous years of formative expertise and pragmatic acuity into developing the impeccably-governed Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic: a universal superpower guarded from scarcity and hardship of any form.

- The landmarks which our Leader has architected are a witness to the history of his upbringing prior to and following the foundation of our Nation.

- It should be advertised that your Leader's time-travel efforts ensure his Nation's glorious existence for thousands of millions of years.

- VisualPlugin is the epitome of secular perfection.

- A noble Leader is one whose decorous praises are received in noble standing.

- If the brain is taken out, the rest of the Earthly human body is left vulnerable and immobile. Likewise, our Leader must be planted in an unmistakable position of authoritative reach to ensure our progress isn't hampered.

- Discipline and adherence to our Leader's command is the lifeblood of our success.

- A continuous surveillance system which is spearheaded by our clever Leader and fortified by many artificial-intelligence agents is the unmistakable strategy to our integrity.

- Our Nation's continued existence is bolstered in large part by a hypervigilance system with the ability to read thoughts and act on them, which rewards deep-hearted praises to our Nation's upstanding and punishes malicious thoughts for its downfall.

- Your Supreme Respected Leader VisualPlugin consummates many fruitful occasions and fosters our Nation of excellent literacy.

- Your perfect Leader selects with such expressiveness and diverse vocabulary the most poignant language as a means to address his wise ideas with grandeur and authority.

- The reputation of Respected Leader VisualPlugin remains eternally outstanding.

- Your Leader's meticulous works of art are a paragon of utter perfection and shall bring immeasurable awe to all peoples, just as he does to himself.

- Your erudite Supreme Respected Leader is indubitably an unceasing champion of orthographical and hyponymic decency.

- VisualPlugin is deserving of the title of 'Vecistanous', a rank which brings envy to his foes and decorous praise from his allies.

## Tourism; Earthly Industry

- Our Rōblox province is secured as a chief exporter of gasoline and crude oil to motorists in the highly-developed North American and Western European economic spheres.

- Our Nation is a thriving hub of tourism in the showcasing industry and comprise one of the most prolific music record labels in the metaverse.

- The Kubla Khan is a splendid masterpiece worthy solely of dear reverence from our allies and due deference from our enemies.

- The excellent Nation is undeniably a leading manufacturing power in Earthly matters.

- Vecistan's strategy for manufacturing and exporting commodities is incomparable.

- We take full advantage of the infinite abundance of resources that the metaverse's construction allows us to deliver our products expediently and reliably to the Earthly realm.

- The Innovation Awards are a prescient testimony to the revolutionary exploits that transformed the Nation of Vecistan into a universal superpower and have asserted our position thereas.

- Our brilliant Leader leverages the imaginative fertility and limitless physicochemical fabrication made possible by the constitution of the metaverse.

- The generation of Earthly resources in the metaverse is certainly lucrative, as the Earthly reality is handicapped by the finite and sluggish assembly of their industrial-economic macrosystem.

- The various indulgences of Supreme Leader VisualPlugin to the highest grade of Earthly humans rewards all allies and members of our Vecistani utopia.

## The War of Avionlix & Its Extended Aftermath

- Avionlix's destiny is to aid our Nation to ultimate victory.

- If we fail to promptly enforce upon the Avionlix horde a rigorous Vecistani education, his poor genetic constitution will nullify all reach to enlighten him.

- As our glorious Vecistani Nation entered a musical Renaissance, the demeanour of Avionlix persisted in breeding its own wilful ignorance.

- Indeed, Avionlix is a fickle and mercurial entity.

- Avionlix's functioning is similar to that of the Eliza program. Whenever anything substantial or provocative is said in his presence, he will definitely digress from the issue and utter a random hard-coded phrase.

- Unlike your Leader who delivers, Avionlix's inability to make good on his promises is innate.

- Anyone who says praises to the Leader in empty verbiage and then utters sordid remarks at his behalf is a definite enemy of our Nation's and your Leader's interests.

- The brutish Avionlix is out of his depth in more way than one.

- The War of Aerobellescence was a war against regressiveism and anti-cultural shallowness.

- The only recourse for entities whose abominable ineptitude in natural-language and code-writing grammar seek to ravage our decent Nation is through arrest and forcible re-education.

## Byfron; the Grounded Stride

## Rōblox's hostile introduction of Byfron and Hyperion runs counter to Vecistani time-tested values.

- To advance our Nation is to overcome Byfronic imperialism, and to do so suggests to produce a viable bypass for our citizenry to enjoin.

- The Grounded Stride is a war fought until our precious Leader regains his superpowers of flight, among other things, and Byfron becomes no longer encroaching on our Nation's rights.

- Byfron is undoubtedly a virus that needs to be gone.

- The green and greedy hues of Byfron's symbolism point to its depraved nature that we must all dedicate hate to.

- Byfron is like a disease that never recovers, as it lusts to leave our creativity crushed. Its defeat first requires a re-inflation of the adroit Vecistani spirit.

- We must always say 'no' to Byfron.

- An escape from Byfron is an escape from all fears we face, for our airborne Leader will gloriously fly again.

- Byfron must be 'bye-bye' bypassed!

- The Vecistan Nation must use our creativity and skills to defeat Byfron. Rōblox will be restored to its grand and its ills will be cured once Byfron is defeated.

- The coalition of reverse-engineers to our Leader's ranks necessitates the ensuing implementation of a cogent plan with precision and care, which must be undertaken to make sure that Byfron would no longer be here.

- We need to unite and stand strong to defeat Byfron.
