	<h1>The Great War of Çıkış</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			The Great War of Çıkış was a war involving the now-moribund nation of <a href="gate-7.html" title="Gate 7">Gate 7</a> and <a href="tutu-runner.html" title="Tutu Runner">Tutu Runner</a> forming an alliance against VisualPlugin that lasted from 2017 to 2019.

		<p>
			In mid-2017, VisualPlugin expressed a desire to conquer <a href="gate-7.html" title="Gate 7">Gate 7</a> without any substantial outside backing or military power. Acting as a one-man militia, VisualPlugin had performed several successful insurrections<a id="cite-ref-1" href="#cite-note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> on Gate 7 territory. His efforts to topple Gate 7 were however not successful in large part owing to VisualPlugin's reportedly poor strategic execution<a id="cite-ref-2" href="#cite-note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and lack of understanding of their political structure. Still resolved to achieve his goal, VisualPlugin sent a formal declaration of war in December 2017 to then-representative <a href="clarramore.html" class="mw-redirect.html" title="CLarramore">CLarramore</a> of Gate 7, officially commencing the War of Çıkış. It should be noted that both CLarramore and VisualPlugin kept a direct line of contact throughout the entire duration of the war and spoke on friendly terms, contrary to Vecistan's narrative. In spite of their covert allyship, VisualPlugin initially avoided engaging directly with CLarramore out of respect for her being three months senior to him, though this decision was revered some time in 2018.

		<p>
			VisualPlugin hired a mercenary from Vyond to infiltrate Gate 7's government offices. The invasion was successful despite the strong security prescence. CLarramore was summoned to the agent, which requested he be ordained a high rank in Gate 7's ascentionbound system. CLarramore obliged, having not been aware of the agent's mission. Once the ordainment procedure was complete, VisualPlugin reconvened with the agent and had himself given the same title. Recognising CLarramore was three months senior to him, VisualPlugin settled not to engage in direct combat with her despite initial success, allowing Gate 7 to remain intact. This was owing to VisualPlugin's policy at the time not to attack 'Age Kings' (i.e., Rōbloxians that are older than oneself).

		</h4>
		<p>
			In an attempt to regain control, VisualPlugin summoned Theresa May<a id="cite-ref-3" href="#cite-note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> to assist him in his takeover of Gate 7, to which she agreed. Having been present at the briefing, CLarramore failed to convince May to reconsider the partnership. It is worth noting that VisualPlugin had not ended up brokering a deal with any of the British Armed Forces in keeping to the original battle tenet of self-reliance. VisualPlugin led May to PW Bossy to state the current whereabouts of Gate 7, as he was feigning an election on behalf of Gate 7. The results for the sham election were 67% in favour for pro-Conservative immigration laws and 33% against. The results were convincing to CLarramore, who ceded due to 'cold, hard evidence' of majority support for a May government in Gate 7. After a brief inauguration ceremony to VisualPlugin, the PBS Logo launched a surprise offence to place CLarramore and VisualPlugin under mind control. With full command of Gate 7 operations, they appointed Caillou as a puppet leader and initiated a genocide of all Gate 7 citizens, leaving only one survivor. By the time the pair were able to regain their consciousness and get Caillou deported<a id="cite-ref-4" href="#cite-note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>, the damage had already been done.

		<p>
			In March 2018, CLarramore wrote an exposé piece on the then-new Vecistan's dictadorial practices. Upon hearing of the story's release, a ploy was set in motion to bait CLarramore into Vecistani territoy, then have him detained indefinitely for treason. This plan, though unlikely to have been effective, was withdrawn soon before the arrest was made. A new plan was enacted to assemble an army outside Gate 7's entrance to seize their operations, The army was to have two of their own pose as tourist surveyors, distracting them just long enough for VisualPlugin to jump in and control their mind remotely. Once that was done, VisualPlugin would summon the new vessel to CLarramore to have <i>her</i> mind controlled, making it easier for Gate 7 to capitulate to Vecistani forces. The operation was unsuccessful, owing to Gate 7's effective universal anti-mind-control system. On 26th March 2018, VisualPlugin fabricated the arrest of CLarramore in an address at the Brairwood University Superdome Stadium<a id="cite-ref-5" href="#cite-note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>. At least 3×12<sup>3</sup> were said to have attended.

		<h3 id="Tutu-Runner">Tutu Runner</h3>
		<p>
			Contrary to popular Vecistani belief, VisualPlugin first met Tutu Runner on friendly terms<a id="cite-ref-6" href="#cite-note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> - to discuss transferring VisualPlugin's soul to a new body whilst keeping the previous one intact. They reached an agreement that sometime in the future, Tutu Runner would initiate a ransomware attack on VisualPlugin's computer, giving him a vector for which to control the Plugin's mind. Despite this encounter being VisualPlugin's first time meeting Tutu Runner, the inverse is not true. In July 2019, VisualPlugin travelled back in time to 24th December 2000 and ensnared Tutu Runner into transforming into a gingerbread man, draining him of his superior intellect. This spell was undone after almost 17 years when one of VisualPlugin's allies attempted to trap his soul in an echo-chamber<a id="cite-ref-7" href="#cite-note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>. Though the retransformation had not been documented, the incident triggered a chain reaction that eventually caused him to get his original likeness back. Following the incident, Tutu Runner was said to be 'hell-bent on defeating VisualPlugin once and for all'. It is worth noting that Tutu Runner was known for overlooking Rōbloxian anatomical idiosynacrisies. This was important as Rōbloxians are conceived to respawn at a designated spot five seconds after their death, rendering the option of murder ineffectual.

		<p>
			VisualPlugin's first battle with Tutu Runner took place in December 2017. Citing retribution for VisualPlugin's unwaving support for policies that Tutu Runner had believed does nothing but hurt the common man<a id="cite-ref-8" href="#cite-note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>, Tutu Runner baited VisualPlugin onto a train bound for Azerbaijan to announce his declaration of VisualPlugin as his nemesis. In following the plan, Tutu Runner threatened VisualPlugin with ransomware and loss over his body to mind control. VisualPlugin appeared overwhelmed by the ransomware, having underestimated Tutu Runner's tenacity. The latter eventually performed mind control on VisualPlugin and had him break the Eiffel Tower off its foundation and lift it to Essex, England. VisualPlugin was believed to become hostile with Tutu Runner during the planned mind-control phase. An unexpected retreat on the prior agreement has been speculated. Analysts say this erratic behaviour is characteristic of VisualPlugin's pshycopathy.

		<p>
			In an effort to gain more strategic insight, Tutu Runner engaged in an alliance with Belluminati and enacted a multifaceted battle strategy. VisualPlugin's ability was hindered by Belluminati installing his own ransomware onto his computer and using the credentials to have his personal Rōblox account banned under false pretences. As VisualPlugin was staying in Vyond at the time, and Vecistan had not yet been established, his ban would trigger an alarm for local police to arrest him. This plan was quickly foiled, as VisualPlugin telepathically switched bodies with Belluminati, effectively evading arrest. VisualPlugin then ran an executable stored on his computer that got rid of the ransomware, undermining the partnership's efficacy. The alliance was eventually dismantled owing to Belluminati's reportedly manipulative behaviour.

		<p>
			Tutu Runner, aiming to appear as a more credible adversary, remodelled his avatar after the late Plotagon master Evil CLoggermore to form a strategic front against VisualPlugin. Five minutespeople, four children and one woman, were hired to use mind-control to lure VisualPlugin into an artificial classroom and stage a <i>behaviour card day</i> performance, distracting VisualPlugin. Concurrently, Tutu Runner would software-lock the room from the inside to prevent means of escape. This plot had been attempted thrice to no success; the first two times due to faulty locks and the third time as a result of a mal-adapted baiting strategy. After confronting Tutu Runner following the third failure, he and VisualPlugin engage in <i>grounding</i> combat, resulting in VisualPlugin as the sole casualty. VisualPlugin was however able to respawn as his funeral took place and track Tutu Runner to the procession.

		<p>
			VisualPlugin initiated a scheme to place a significant area of Vyond outside of Vecistan under his mind control. After initial tests, the technique was proven a resounding success. Tutu Runner, having been present in the trial, was able to feign being under VisualPlugin's mind-control. This is because his higher IQ score gave him immunity to this attack. After an office invasion that ended in him being teleported to Turkey, Tutu Runner engaged in a confrontation with VisualPlugin. This again caused Tutu Runner to be taken to an undisclosed headquarters of the PBS Kids Logo, who failed to perform mind-control on him. Tutu Runner was then successfully placed under the control of VisualPlugin, with Alexa as an intermediary. Alexa has a reported IQ higher than that of the belligerants. The mind-controlled Tutu Runner then cloned Caillou and Boris, two of the PBS Kids Logo's properties, and used the doubles to lead VisualPlugin to an enhanced mind-control formula. The victims, in being replicated, were transported to a prison cell under VisualPlugin's surveillance. To complete the retrieval, Tutu Runner was teleported to the doubles and was ultimately released from control soon after. Anticipating a surprise attack, VisualPlugin sent the Caillou and Boris clones to distract him. As per Visual's scheme, a stalled Tutu Runner was easily able to get rid of the clones. Surprisingly, Tutu Runner quickly left the scene of the formula, citing VisualPlugin's ability to respawn.

		<p>
			In an effort to assure VisualPlugin's death before the midnight of New Year's 2019, Tutu Runner set up a ruse offering free Rōbux at a public site in Vyond and blackmailled the victims into killing VisualPlugin, else they be frozen in time. Despite the success of his extortion scheme, and Tutu Runner's prior assassinations, VisualPlugin was able to regenerate quickly after.

		<h4 id="Battle-of-the-6th-Bloxys"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_WNm7Bg_NY&amp;list=PLO5PZUR0wDLA4mEw1mqLVG7eYDwONiwoS&amp;index=25">Battle of the 6th Bloxys</a></h4>
		<p><a href="bloxy.html" title="Bloxys">The Bloxys</a> are an annual awards event show produced by the Rōblox Events Team and re-prepared by Vecistan to affirm VisualPlugin's leadership. In order to ascertain that VisualPlugin himself may not interfere with Tutu Runner's performance, he decided first to ban VisualPlugin from the server the Vecistani broadcast of the Bloxys was to air from. A scheme was then set in motion to inflitrate the airing stage, rewrite <a href="television.html" class="mw-redirect.html" title="Vecistani State TV">the over-the-air broadcast</a>, and alter the list of winners. VisualPlugin started a new advance against Tutu Runner by hiring mercenaries to engage in a stand off and to forcibly reverse the ban that was previously placed on VisualPlugin. This however was unsuccessful, as Tutu Runner swiftly banned each mercenary. As a result, the Vecistani flag on the TV broadcast was briefly replaced with a gold-emboss image of Tutu Runner<a id="cite-ref-9" href="#cite-note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>. Owing to VisualPlugin's decision to wait a few minutes before sending more mercenaries over, VisualPlugin had the advantage of surprise. When the first mercenary engaged with Tutu Runner, he was unable to react quickly before VisualPlugin was unbanned from the stage. Once confirmation was received, VisualPlugin positioned himself next to the mercenary and had Tutu Runner murdered by sword, ending the battle in a decisive victory.

		<p>
			The belligerants were planning an excursion an invite-only event in the Rōblox metaverse in August 2019. Upon learning that VisualPlugin had not been given an invitation, a robot decoy was allegedly created in the image of Tutu Runner to accompany him. Having quickly gathered this intel, Tutu Runner likewise had a decoy robot of himself designed, despite having been given an official invitation. Both parties were able to enter the venue. Although Tutu Runner remained nondescript immediately after entering, VisualPlugin allegedly performed mind control on every patron during an event presenation, inclusive of the presenter herself. VisualPlugin was then put under a mind-control trance once theymet in a private room.

		<p>
			The official end to the War of Çıkış was marked by Tutu Runner's withdrawal from conflict in late 2019 after VisualPlugin reportedly gave him a life <i>grounding</i> sentence (i.e., solitary confinement). After his escape, Tutu Runner chose to cease fighting since he recognised that 'the war would have no end if I kept fighting with VisualPlugin, irrespective of how much of the time I win or lose'. To maintain the narrative that the war was decisively won, Vecistani armed forces are deliberately not investigating the whereabouts of Tutu Runner.
