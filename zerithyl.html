			Zerithyl was a Godrodian warlord outside Vecistan for the 2018 massacres, and ensuing kidnappings, in Vecistani-occupied GoAnimate City<a id="cite-ref-:0-1-0" href="#cite-note-:0-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>. The rampage had taken place soon following Zerithyl's escape from prison in March 2018. His GoAnimate form is a green silhouette of Boris, though he had not been seen in other metaverses.

		<h2 id="Victims">Victims</h2>

			Between March and April 2018, his victims were gathered into cohorts of between 500 and 5000 GoAnimators and forced to work in a private cotton field. Cohorts were then tortured by watching kids' television shows for hours each day - including Curious Buddies, Dora The Explorer. Zerithyl was known to group victims based on a common trait, as was the case with a cohort of 4000 Vecistani Jews<a id="cite-ref-:0-1-1" href="#cite-note-:0-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>. Another with 5000 included ethnic Ragamuffins and Juggalos. Zerithyl was sometimes known to invite colleagues to assist him in torture sessions.

			On the night of 16th April 2018, VisualPlugin was kidnapped by Zerithyl. Learning of Zerithyl's abilities of clairvoyance and evasion of mind-control<a id="cite-ref-:0-1-2" href="#cite-note-:0-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>, VisualPlugin was successfully able to teleport Zerithyl to 'the far reaches of his mind'<a id="cite-ref-:0-1-3" href="#cite-note-:0-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>, effectively imprisoning him. This was likely possible due to the fact that Zerithyl, despite being precognisant of VisualPlugin's teleporation scheme, was unable to stop it.

		<h2 id="Reputation">Reputation</h2>
		<p>
			For Vecistani escapees, Zerithyl represents the Vecistan's heavy hand of censorship of facts that undermine its strength. As mass-media is strictly censored in Vecistan, citizens living outside of GoAnimate City are completely unaware of Zerithyl's existence. Vecistan's decision to withhold this intel from general Vecistani discourse was due to the unavoidably lasting effects of the murders in GoAnimate City, despite VisualPlugin's victory.
