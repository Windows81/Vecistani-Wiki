	<h1>Bloxys</h1>
	<p><strong>The Bloxys</strong> are an annual awards event show produced by the Rōblox Events Team and <a href="television.html">re-prepared by Vecistan</a> into a 15-minute-long special broadcast to affirm VisualPlugin's leadership. Having been broadcast each year since 2018, the Bloxys special would reair hourly after the final production version is completed.

	<h2>The 5th Bloxy Awards (2018)</h2>
	<p>
		Unlike with subsequent special broadcasts, a full recording had not been released outside of Vecistan. The internal broadcast had an airtime of five minutes despite only 53 seconds having been posted on the internet<citeref>1</citeref>. An unfinished rendition of the same scene had previously been released<citeref>2</citeref>, but had since been unlisted.

	<h2>The 6th Bloxy Awards (2019)</h2>
	<p>
		The 6th Bloxy Awards special was the first of its kind to have a full uncut recording released online<citeref>3</citeref>.

	<h2>The 7th Bloxy Awards (2020)</h2>
	<p>
		The 2020 Bloxy special placed a heavy emphasis on <a href="vyond.html">GoAnimate Wrapper</a>, as the Bloxys special was the first major mass-media project since Wrapper's release. This special broadcast was also the first to tie in with a live face-to-face speech from VisualPlugin. The <a href="Vecistani_Industry_of_Creative_Works">Vecistani Industry of Creative Works</a> was commissioned to design the venue, as the location was set for the <a href="roblox.html">Rōblox province</a>. An estimated total of 240 guests attended the speech on 2020-03-01. Following the event, guests would be instructed to perform a series of animations on loop. The whole event would be recorded on video, with select clips being used for the television special. Other locations designed by the ministry, such as <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2960624866/Septicentricity-no-longer-in-progress">Septicentricity</a>
