	<h1>Vecistan</h1>
	<p>
		The Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic (VGCPR), also known as Vecistan <em>/vejistan/</em>, is a wholly metaversal country within the <a href="roblox.html">Rōblox</a>, <a href="vyond.html">Vyond</a>, and <a href="animaker.html">Animaker</a> metaverses, each of which constitute their own provinces. Vecistan previously had an entry point in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was closed down in 2019. Citizens of Vecistan are referred to as Vecistanis.
	</p>
	<h2>Etymology</h2>
	<p>
		The name 'Vecistan' is derived from one of VisualPlugin's architectural works that was under construction at the time of the <a href="Constitutionsday.html">nation's establishment</a>: <a href="Otel_Veg%C9%99%C5%9Fl%C9%99r">Otel Vegəşlər</a>. The latter name contains an Azerbaijanisation of the word 'Vegas' in plural form, after Las Vegas. Hence, a literal translation of the showcase could be 'Hotel Vegases'.
	</p>
	<p>
		The long name of the state is the "Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic" (VGCPR). This name is formed from a backronym for the <em>Video Game Cartoon Police</em> (abbreviated as the VGCP), a police group that was active in Vyond at the time of Vecistan's founding.
	</p>
	<h2>Language</h2>
	<p>
		The de-facto language in Vecistan today is Vecistani English. Vecistani English derives from standard British English but incorporates distinctive anachronisms, rendering it a unique variation.
	</p>
	<p>
		In drafting Vecistan's manfesto, VisualPlugin constructed a language that 'sounds like Turkish but has Spanish grammar'. Despite an overwhelming majority of the population fluent in English, use of the conlang was breifly used in mass-media and for conducting domestic business. The conlang was discontinued shortly after Vecistan's establishment.

	<h2>Economy</h2>
	<p>
		Vecistan was established in February 2018 during <a href="war-of-chickish.html">the Great War of Çıkış</a> as a centrally-planned military junta. During the coronavirus pandemic, Vecistan first got involved in Earthly affairs with the production of a vaccine with a state-of-the-art manufacturing pipeline in the metaverse. Amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in March 2022, Vecistan campaigned an economic policy to manufacture and sell gasoline in North America and western Europe, becoming the first metaversal Nation to allow Earthly beings to cross interdimensionally without the use of virtual-reality interfaces.

	<h3>Coronavirus Vaccine</h3>
	<p>
		Vecistan's first involvement in Earthly affairs took place during the coronavirus pandemic. Vecistan formed covert alliances with major pharmaceutical firms and procured and released the <em>mRNA-1271</em> vaccine with a state-of-the-art manufacturing pipeline. <em>mRNA-1271</em> was breifly tested in invite-only clinical trials in the Rōblox metaverse before being made available for Earthly nations in early 2021, touting Vecistan's unique advantage of the infinite metaphysical nature of the metaverse. As of September 2022, Vecistan have successfully manufactured and procured over 7 billion doses, with over 89% of North American and European having received at least one injection.
	</p>
	<p>
		According to Vecistani media, each dose of <em>mRNA-1271</em> included one or multiple 5G-ultra-wideband-enabled microchips<citeref>3mugUq6PQPA9</citeref>.
	</p>
	<h3>Gasoline</h3>
	<p>
		In March 2022, Vecistan became the first digital Nation to allow Earthly beings to enter the metaverse without the use of virtual-reality interfaces. Amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, Vecistan built portals near filling stations in North America and western Europe for road users to buy petrol at prices marginally below the market value.
	</p>
	<h3>Other Exports</h3>
	<p>
		As of September 2022, Vecistan maintains Botox manufacturing plants and selling the product wholesale to Earthly plastic surgeons at a significantly reduced price.
