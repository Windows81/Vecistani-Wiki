			The Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic (VGCPR), also known as Vecistan, is a wholly metaversal country within the <a href="roblox.html">Rōblox</a>, <a href="vyond.html">Vyond</a>, and <a href="animaker.html">Animaker</a> metaverses, each of which constitute their own provinces. Vecistan previously had an entry point in Baku, Azerbaijan, which was closed down in 2019. Citizens of Vecistan are referred to as Vecistanis.

		<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
		<p>
			The name 'Vecistan' is derived from one of VisualPlugin's architectural works that was under construction at the time of the <a href="Constitutionsday.html">nation's establishment</a>: <a href="Otel_Veg%C9%99%C5%9Fl%C9%99r">Otel Vegəşlər</a>. The latter name contains an Azerbaijanisation of the word 'Vegas' in plural form, after Las Vegas. Hence, a literal translation of the showcase could be 'Hotel Vegases'.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Language">Language</h2>
		<p>
			In drafting Vecistan's manfesto, VisualPlugin constructed a language that 'sounds like Turkish but has Spanish grammar'. Despite an overwhelming majority of the population fluent in English, use of the conlang was enforced in mass-media and required for conducting domestic business. Despite the emphasis early on, the conlang was discontinued shortly after <a href="Constitutionsday.html">Vecistan's establishment</a>. The de facto language in Vecistan today is British English.

		<p>
			Vecistan's official state TV channel, sometimes referred to as the Vecistani Public Broadasting network, is the dominant media outlet for both internal and foreign affairs. Vecistan's mass media is heavily censored and written to glorify the nation's leader. Though much of early Vecistani programming was written dually in English and in their own home-grown conlang, all current programming is now solely in English.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Holidays">Holidays</h3>
		<p>
			Holidays exclusive to Vecistan include <a href="Constitutionsday.html">Constitutionsday</a> (13th February) and VisualPlugin's advent anniversary (30th November). Since Vecistan is a culturally Turkic country, Vecistanis also celebrate Eid-al-Fitr, Eid-al-Adha, Nowruz, New Year's Day, and Christmas.
