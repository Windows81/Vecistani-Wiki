	<h1>Animaker Province</h1>
	<p>
		The Animaker province is a contiguous area of land within the <a href="https://www.animaker.com">Animaker</a> metaverse acquired by Vecistan on 24th June 2021. The Animaker province has been advertised in <a href="television.html">Vecistani media</a> as a 'monument to the unquestionable victory against high-handed and authoritarian forces that limited the freedom of expression of its populace'.
	</p>
	<h2>Pre-Vecistani Animaker</h2>
	<p>
		Vecistan promotes their newly occupied territory as a haven of freedom for aspiring animators<citeref>1</citeref>. Prior to the acquisition, non-paying citizens were reportedly unable to utilise custom fonts or add child-form characters to their animation, and were repeated extorted into paying Animaker to have permission to do so<citeref>2</citeref>. In spite of those restictions, pre-Vecistani academic surveys of the Animaker lands compared them to a desert in that both were devoid of life.
	</p>
	<h2>Integration into Vecistan</h2>
	<p>
		VisualPlugin first decided to conduct a special operation in Animaker on 23rd June 2021, owing to the relative completion of the <a href="vyond.html">Wrapper</a> project. The next day, VisualPlugin addressed the nation with a surprise announcement of the integration of Animaker's metaverse into Vecistan. The quick completion of mission was reported to have been in effect of VisualPlugin's prior experience in reverse-engineering web apps. The entire procedure of entry to the Vecistani province, according to internal documents, involves nothing more than basic access to Animaker, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-modify-headers/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa">Requestly</a> browser extension installed onto that browser, and the appropriate scripts to execute.
