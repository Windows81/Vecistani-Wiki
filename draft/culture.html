<h1>Vecistani Culture</h1>
<p>
	Vecistani culture comprises an invented set of customs and traditions derived by the actions and edicts of the incumbent <a href="vecistanous.html">Vecistanous</a>.
</p>
<h2>Mass Media</h2>
<p>
	Vecistan's official state TV channel, sometimes referred to as the Vecistani Public Broadasting network, is the dominant media outlet for both internal and foreign affairs. Vecistan's mass media is heavily censored and carefully written to glorify the nation's leader. Though much of early Vecistani programming was written dually in English and in their own home-grown conlang, all current programming is now solely in English.

<h2>Holidays</h2>
<p>
	Holidays exclusive to Vecistan include <a href="Constitutionsday.html">Constitutionsday</a> (13th February) and VisualPlugin's advent anniversary (30th November). Since Vecistan is a culturally Turkic country, Vecistanis also celebrate Eid-al-Fitr, Eid-al-Adha, Nowruz, New Year's Day, and Christmas as minor holidays. Since Vecistanis comprise almost entirely of metaversal beings without any need to eat or drink, fasting for Ramadan is not observed.
</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>
	Vecistan is a secularist country. Although Vecistanis typically idenfiy as Turkic-adjacent, places of worship are rare to find and most citizens do not religiously observe Islamic holidays.
</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
	The de-facto language in Vecistan today is Vecistani English. Vecistani English derives from standard British English but incorporates distinctive anachronisms, rendering it a unique variation.
</p>
<p>
	In drafting Vecistan's manfesto, VisualPlugin constructed a language that 'sounds like Turkish but has Spanish grammar'. Despite an overwhelming majority of the population fluent in English, use of the conlang was breifly used in mass-media and for conducting domestic business. The conlang was discontinued shortly after Vecistan's establishment.
