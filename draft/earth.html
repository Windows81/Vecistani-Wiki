<h1>Earth</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Earth</strong> is an endonym in common use given to a spheroid planet inhabited by sapient <em>human</em> beings. Vecistan maintains diplomatic ties with some Earthly nations, including the United States and Israel.
</p>
<h2>Metaphysics</h2>
<p>
	Earthly metaphysics is dominated by complex yet predictable laws of conservation, gravity, and relativity, among others. Natural phenomena are however more difficult to manipulate and scrutinise on Earth than in other Vecistani-involved universes. The laws of physics remain applicable at any distance outside of Earth. However, human living conditions are generally more difficult to sustain outside the planet's atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
	Humans only live once with no ability to voluntarily respawn in their home planet. For this reason, death is considered a grave topic across Earthly ethnic groups, which can be challenging for alien diplomats to Earthly nations to comprehend.
</p>
<p>
	Humans frequently communicate with sapient alien beings from other universes using computer programs via a corporate-controlled medium or, since early 2022, through portal travel. Notwithstanding, humans are isolated from and generally unfamiliar with extraterrestrial sapient species in their own universe, with little credible literature existing on the topic of specific alien populations.
</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>
	The macro-economic unit on Earth is the nation-state, of which ~200 exist. Almost all major settlements on Earth are under the jurisdiction of a nation-state country. People are almost always being citizens of one or more of these countries. This is different from other Vecistani-involved universes, where cities are commonly found to be independent settlements. Militaries and armed services do exist on Earth with an essential function of protecting their cities from foreign attack. The largest and most powerful militaries are controlled by a national government, usually with a multi-layered chain-of-command system.
</p>
<p>
	Private businesses also heavily contribute to Earth's economy, with the largest ones performing operations in multiple countries. Companies, unlike governments, manufacture most goods and services useful or necessary for humans, such as food and medicine. Others provide services for long-distance communication or leisure activities. Many of the world's largest companies are structured as corporations, having been established in the United States, western Europe, or China owing to various international economic factors.
</p>
<p>
	Since the turn of the 21st century, humans frequently communicate with sapient alien beings from other universes using intermediary computer programs via corporate-controlled tools. For example, humans would communicate to <a href="roblox.html">Rōbloxian</a> society using proprietary software from <em>Roblox Corporation</em>. Prior to Vecistan's dipolmatic actions in 2022, these intermediary companies held full control of the flow of information to and from other universes.
</p>
<h2>Vecistani Involvement</h2>
<p>
	Vecistan first got involved in Earthly affairs in early 2021 with the production of a Covid-19 vaccine, expanding into other industries in 2022 amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war.
</p>
<h3>Coronavirus Vaccine</h3>
<p>
	Vecistan's first involvement in Earthly affairs took place during the coronavirus pandemic. Vecistan formed alliances with major pharmaceutical firms and tech giants on the planet with the objective to procure and release the <em>mRNA-1271</em> vaccine<citeref>3mugUq6PQPA9</citeref>. <em>mRNA-1271</em> was breifly tested in invite-only clinical trials in the Rōblox metaverse before being made available for Earthly nations in early 2021, touting Vecistan's unique advantage of the infinite metaphysical nature of their metaverses. As of September 2022, Vecistan have successfully manufactured and procured over 7 billion doses, with over 89% of North American and European having received at least one injection.
</p>
<h3>Gasoline</h3>
<p>
	In March 2022, amid the gasoline crisis at the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, Vecistan built portals near filling stations in North America and western Europe<citeref>H1_kE7FhW50</citeref> and sold petrol direct-to-consumers at prices marginally below the market value. In opening the portals, Vecistan became the first alien nation to allow humans to enter other universes.
</p>
<h3>Other Exports</h3>
<p>
	As of September 2022, Vecistan maintains Botox manufacturing plants and selling the product wholesale to Earth-based plastic surgeons at a significantly reduced price<citeref>-2Y0gUmhE9c</citeref>.
