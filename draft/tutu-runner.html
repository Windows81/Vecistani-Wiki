	<h1>Tutu Runner</h1>
	<p>
		Tutu Runner (1987 - present), also known colloquially as Tutu Guy and formerly as Gingerbread Guy, is a Vyondic political revolutionary, thought leader, and former boy genius. Between 2017 and 2019, he was a main belligerent in the <a href="war-of-chickish.html">War of Çıkış</a>. Following his voluntary withdrawal from the war in late 2019, not much is known about his whereabouts, aside from a few choice interviews on anti-Vecistani news shows.
	</p>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<p>
		Tutu Runner was born on 31st June 1987 in an alternate 'stupid' universe in Vyond. At his first day of school, he was bullied for his appearance. He stated in an interview with prominent anti-Vecistani newspaper <i>The Veggie-stani</i> that the bullying stopped immediately when he flaunted his flying skills at such a young age.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite having lived his entire early life in the 'stupid' universe, Tutu Runner's cognitive capacity was proven to be exceptional despite extensive testing. Before his fifth birthday, he was perceived to possess a general IQ score of 250.
	</p>
	<p>
		In July 2019, VisualPlugin travelled back in time to 24th December 2000 and ensnared Tutu Runner into transforming into a gingerbread man, effectively lobotomising him. This spell was undone after almost 17 years when one of VisualPlugin's allies attempted to trap his soul in an echo-chamber<citeref>2</citeref> before soon being released and retransformed by The Belluminati. Though the retransformation had not been documented, the incident triggered a chain reaction which eventually caused him to get his original likeness back and develop hostility against VisualPlugin.
	</p>
	<h2>Relationship with VisualPlugin</h2>
	<p>
		Contrary to popular Vecistani belief, VisualPlugin first met Tutu Runner on friendly terms<citeref>3</citeref>: to discuss transferring VisualPlugin's soul to a new body whilst keeping the previous one intact. They reached an agreement that sometime in the future, Tutu Runner would initiate a ransomware attack on VisualPlugin's computer, giving him a vector for which to control VisualPlugin's original body.
	</p>
	<h2>Aftermath</h2>
	<p>
		The official end to the War of Çıkış was marked by Tutu Runner's withdrawal from conflict in late 2019 after VisualPlugin sentenced him for life to solitary confinement. After his escape, Tutu Runner reportedly chose to stop fighting with VisualPlugin, citing that 'the war would have no end if I kept fighting with VisualPlugin, irrespective of how much of the time I win or lose'.
	</p>
	<p>
		As of 2022-03-21, Vecistan is deliberately not investigating the whereabouts of Tutu Runner. This is to maintain the narrative that the war was decisively won, and therefore ensure morale in Vecistan remains high.
