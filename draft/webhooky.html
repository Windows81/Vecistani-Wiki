<h1>Webhooky</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Webhooky</strong> (stylised <em>Webhòóky</em>) was a webhook service for Rōblox developers to programmatically forward data to Discord, running from approx. 2018-02-24 to 2019-09-22<citeref>p5</citeref>. Webhooky was exploited by Vecistan as long-term message-interception project for its entire duration of service. It was an operation in the Rōblox metaverse that intercepted chatlogs from hundreds of games on Rōblox, including Arsenal<citeref>p3</citeref> and Boho Salon.
</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>
	VisualPlugin provisioned a forwarding server on 000webhost which developers can direct webhook requests to Discord. To provision Webhooky, the developer would manually replace all links to <em>http://discordapp.com/api/webhooks</em> with <em>http://le-blog.webutu.com/discordWebhook.php</em>, keeping all other request parameters the same.
</p>
<p>
	As Vecistan is coodinated as a centrally-planned economy with a strictly authoritarian government, Webhooky was designed to be a surveillance apparatus<citeref>p1</citeref>. VisualPlugin used this leverage to poach well-known Rōblox developers and often infiltrated games on Rōblox which utilise Webhooky with intent to commit mass-mind-control.
</p>
<p>
	A covert militia of robots was hired<citeref>p3</citeref> to undertake the task of mind-controlling millions of unsuspecting Rōblox players. They were also responsible to relaying stats on Webhooky's usage to VisualPlugin<citeref>p4</citeref>.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
	The Discord chat platform provides tools for software developers to send programmatic data to a registered server using webhooks. In early 2018, Discord's webhook API was commonly in use with Rōblox games due to their ease of setup. However, due to rampant abuse<citeref>x1</citeref>, Discord temporarily blocked all direct incoming webhook requests from Rōblox circa 2018-02-22 until circa 2019-05-01<citeref>p4</citeref>.
</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>
	After the service's initial release in 2018-02-24, hundreds of games on Rōblox switched their API links to Webhooky. In August 2018, Counter Blox implemented the URL endpoint into their code<citeref>df33</citeref>. Boho Salon, soon after rebooting in December, decided to make use of Webhooky to relay user feedback. The service was used by several simulators and many war clans on Rōblox.
</p>
<p>
	Webhooky spawned small-scale protests during periods of downtime<citeref>p2</citeref>. These protests evoked a rare reaction in that VisualPlugin, rather than clamp down, would assuade protesters and release a fix after some time. <a href="tutu-runner.html">Tutu Runner</a> attended and led a protest on 2019-01-07, where a heated exchange took place after others left.
</p>
<p>
	During the <a href="war-of-chickish.html">War of Çıkış</a>, a convert recon operation into Webhooky's internals by Tutu Runner led him to successfully perform mind-control on VisualPlugin<citeref>p3</citeref> on an unspecified date in 2019. VisualPlugin was freed from mind-control on 2019-05-01 when Tutu Runner recognised that the start of the spell was not timestamped properly<citeref>p4</citeref>.
</p>
<h3>Discontinuation</h3>
<p>
	In 2019-09-22, Webhooky intermittently experienced a prolonged period of downtime before being forcibly discontinued in 2019-09-24. The likely cause of distruption was an overload of incoming HTTP requests to Webhooky; 000webhost had a policy of halting service to websites which receive excessive traffic.
</p>
<h2>Controversies</h2>
<h3>Downtimes</h3>
<p>
	Webhooky experienced multiple periods of prolonged downtime on account of all IP traffic being forwarded from just one IP address<citeref>p2</citeref>. Other downtimes were caused by limitations of 000webhost's gratis use.
</p>
<p>
	Until approx. 2018-07-01<citeref>df</citeref>, Webhooky was unable to forward requests between the hours of 10:00 and 11:00 UTC. Prolonged periods of downtime took place from 2019-09-22 until the service's forcible discontinuation two days later<citeref>p5</citeref>. Other webhook solutions (such as <em>osyr.is</em>) were said to be more reliable in this respect.
</p>
<h3>Surveillance</h3>
<p>
	Webhooky was designed as a surveillance apparatus<citeref>p1</citeref> to align with Vecistani interests. Other webhook proxies at the time (such as <em>osyr.is</em>) respected users' freedoms and did retain any personal data. Certain experiences were added to a do-not-track list<citeref>gh32</citeref> upon each developer's request.
