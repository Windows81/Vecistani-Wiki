<h1>The Great War of Çıkış</h1>
<p>
	The Great War of Çıkış was a conflict involving the now-moribund nation of <a href="gate-7.html">Gate 7</a> and <a href="tutu-runner.html">Tutu Runner</a> forming an alliance against <a href="visualplugin.html">VisualPlugin</a>, and since 2018, Vecistan, that lasted between 30th July 2017 and 9th November 2019. The entirety of the conflict was fought within the Vyond metaverse.
</p>
<h2>Belligerants</h2>
<h3>VisualPlugin</h3>
<p>
	In mid-2017, VisualPlugin expressed a desire to conquer <a href="gate-7.html">Gate 7</a> without any substantial outside backing or military power, so as to retain full control of any new territory he may find. VisualPlugin has had a history of political-warfare expeditions in the Vyond metaverse<citeref>bhY9R7z7UVg</citeref>.
</p>
<h3>Gate 7</h3>
<p>
	VisualPlugin performed several insurrections<citeref>tNUrAFp_Ruo</citeref> on Gate 7 territory during the war. Fighting with Gate 7 ended in March 2018 when VisualPlugin temporarily withdrew from the Vyond metaverse. CLarramore narrowly escaped arrest.
</p>
<p>
	VisualPlugin sent a formal declaration of war in July 2017 to then-representative <a href="clarramore.html">CLarramore</a> of Gate 7, officially commencing the War of Çıkış. Both CLarramore and VisualPlugin kept a direct line of contact throughout the entire duration of the war. VisualPlugin initially avoided directly engaging in battle with CLarramore out of respect for her being three months senior to him, though this concession was reversed some time in 2018.
</p>
<p>
	The first documented meeting of CLarramore and VisualPlugin took place on 2017-07-29<citeref>FP3f-Qs3pBE</citeref>, where they surfed a flying aeroplane to an undisclosed field near Baku, Azerbaijan.
</p>
<h3>Tutu Runner</h3>
<p>
	Contrary to popular Vecistani belief, VisualPlugin first met Tutu Runner on friendly terms. Both parties met initially to negotiate transferring VisualPlugin's soul to a new body whilst keeping the previous one intact<citeref>I3IVm-bvxkg</citeref>. They reached an agreement that sometime in the future, Tutu Runner would initiate a ransomware attack on VisualPlugin's computer, giving him a vector for which to control VisualPlugin's original body.
</p>
<p>
	Despite this encounter being VisualPlugin's first time meeting Tutu Runner, the inverse is not true. In July 2019, VisualPlugin travelled back in time to 24th December 2000 and ensnared Tutu Runner into transforming into a gingerbread man, effectively lobotomising him. This spell was undone after almost 17 years when one of VisualPlugin's allies attempted to trap his soul in an echo-chamber<citeref>0DSOpZvUsZQ</citeref>. Though the retransformation had not been documented, the incident triggered a chain reaction which eventually caused him to get his original likeness back and develop hostility against VisualPlugin.
</p>
<h2>Significant Battles</h2>
<h3>The First Incursion</h3>
<p>
	VisualPlugin hired a Vyondic mercenary to infiltrate Gate 7's government offices on 2017-07-30<citeref>tNUrAFp_Ruo</citeref>. The invasion was successful despite the strong security prescence. CLarramore was summoned to the agent, which requested he be ordained a high rank in Gate 7's ascentionbound system. CLarramore obliged, having not been aware of the agent's mission. Once the ordainment procedure was complete, VisualPlugin reconvened with the agent and had himself given the same title. After recognising that CLarramore was three months older than to him, VisualPlugin settled not to engage in direct combat with her, allowing Gate 7 to remain intact.
</p>
<h3>The Californian Incursion</h3>
<p>
	In an attempt to regain control, VisualPlugin summoned Theresa May to assist him in his takeover of Gate 7, to which she agreed<citeref>zI2zMGhPOsA</citeref>. In keeping to the original battle tenet of self-reliance, VisualPlugin had not ended up brokering a deal with any of the British Armed Forces. VisualPlugin remotely organised a sham immigration referrendum in Gate 7 with May as the leading Tory candidate. The results were 67% in favour for the pro-Conservative approach and 33% against. The results were convincing to CLarramore, who ceded due to 'cold, hard evidence' of majority support. Despite the narrow scope originally proposed in the referrendum, VisualPlugin used that as leverage to seize power in Gate 7's council. After a brief inauguration ceremony, the PBS Logo launched a surprise offence to abduct CLarramore and VisualPlugin. With full command of Gate 7 operations, the PBS Kids logo appointed Caillou as a puppet leader and murdered Gate 7's entire population, leaving only one survivor. CLarramore and VisualPlugin were eventually able to regain their consciousness and get Caillou deported.
</p>
<h3>Barney Error 127</h3>
<p>
	Tutu Runner's first offensive took place in December 2017<citeref>LOfMRtnLQ4c</citeref>. Despite this being VisualPlugin's first encounter with Tutu Runner, the latter had met a future version of VisualPlugin once in 2000. Both parties met in an undisclosed location in Vyond to arrange a battle which would result in VisualPlugin's essence being transferred to a new body. The circumstances that led to their first meeting are currently unknown.
</p>
<p>
	To prepare for a staged attack, Tutu Runner baited VisualPlugin onto a train bound for Azerbaijan to announce his declaration of VisualPlugin as his nemesis<citeref>dS5B-aGp8UY</citeref>. Tutu Runner threatened VisualPlugin with ransomware and loss of his body to mind control. VisualPlugin appeared overwhelmed by the ransomware, having underestimated Tutu Runner's tenacity. The latter eventually performed mind control on VisualPlugin and had him break the Eiffel Tower off its foundation and leviate it to Essex in the east of England.
</p>
<p>
	Tutu Runner's hostility was not yet known to VisualPlugin, as the latter would not travel in time to perform the curse until two years after. For this reason, it is speculated that Tutu Runner intended to sabotage the agreement by manipulating the reincarnation process to weaken VisualPlugin. However, the new body had no negative effects on VisualPlugin's strength, marking this ploy as a loss for Tutu Runner.
</p>
<h3>Alliance with Belluminati</h3>
<p>
	In an effort to gain more strategic insight, Tutu Runner engaged in an alliance with Belluminati and enacted a multifaceted battle strategy<citeref>0ICoBjfIR4I</citeref>. VisualPlugin's ability was hindered by Belluminati installing his own ransomware onto his computer and using the credentials to have his personal Rōblox account banned under false pretences. As VisualPlugin was staying in Vyond at the time, and Vecistan had not yet been established, his ban would trigger an alarm for local police to arrest him. This plan was quickly foiled, as VisualPlugin telepathically switched bodies with Belluminati, effectively evading arrest. VisualPlugin then ran an executable stored on his computer that got rid of the ransomware, undermining the partnership's efficacy. The alliance was eventually dismantled owing to Belluminati's reportedly manipulative behaviour.
</p>
<h3>Battle of 1st Jaunary 2018</h3>
<p>
	On 2017-12-31, Tutu Runner orders VisualPlugin to appear as the defendent in a sham trial<citeref>NJNwDml05uE</citeref>. As a result, the sentencing is a prohibition against VisualPlugin from entering the new year, which he accomplishes through a time-freeze spell effective nanoseconds before midnight. The exact reasoning for his apparent lack of resistence to the order is not currently known. After an undisclosed period of time, the spell is broken on its own. Tutu Runner is immediately notified and discovered VisualPlugin sleeping outside a <em>Çoxi Çisəs</em> bakery.
</p>
<h3>Arrest of CLarramore</h3>
<p>
	In March 2018, CLarramore published an exposé piece on the recent implementation of Vecistan's dictadorial practices<citeref>YRt9iUPqSNw</citeref>. Upon hearing of the story's release, Vecistan set a ploy in motion to bait CLarramore into Vecistani territory, then have her detained indefinitely for treason. This plan, unlikely to be effective, was immediately withdrawn just as the arrest was made. An improved plan was enacted to assemble an army outside the Gate 7 border checkpoint to interfere with enemy operations. The army was to have two of their own pose as tourist surveyors. Their job was to distract any Gate-7 civilians who passed through for just long enough for VisualPlugin to jump in and control their mind remotely. Once done, VisualPlugin would infiltrate the border navigate the newly-controlled vessel to CLarramore to have <em>her</em> mind-controlled, making it easier for Gate 7 to capitulate to Vecistani forces.
</p>
<p>
	The operation was unsuccessful, owing to Gate 7's effective universal anti-mind-control system. On 26th March 2018, VisualPlugin made an address at the Brairwood University Superdome Stadium where he feigned successfully arresting CLarramore<citeref>8KsUSReZgB8</citeref>.
</p>
<h3>Battle of Evil CLoggermore</h3>
<p>
	Tutu Runner, aiming to appear as a more credible adversary, remodelled his Vyondic avatar after the late Plotagon master Evil CLoggermore in October 2018. Six guerillas (four children, one woman, and a look-alike of VisualPlugin) were then hired to use hypnosis to lure VisualPlugin into an artificial classroom<citeref>PIF_hCgl32Y</citeref> and stage a <em>behaviour card day</em> performance. Concurrently, Tutu Runner would software-lock the room from the inside to attempt to prevent means of escape.
</p>
<p>
	This plot was attempted thrice to no success: the first two times due to faulty locks and the third time as a result of a mal-adapted baiting strategy. After confronting Tutu Runner following the third failure, he and VisualPlugin engaged in combat, with the look-alike used as a brief decoy). The duel resulting in VisualPlugin getting temporarily slain. Howeever, Rōbloxians are conceived to respawn at a designated spot five seconds after their death, rendering the option of murder ineffectual. VisualPlugin respawned as his funeral took place and followed Tutu Runner to the procession. Tutu Runner was known for overlooking Rōbloxian anatomical idiosynacrisies, including that which comes with slaying VisualPlugin.
</p>
<h3>'Mind-Control Monday'</h3>
<p>
	Taking cues from <em>The Incredibles 2</em> and <em>Teen Titans Go to the Movies</em>
	<citeref>4hCLfSnZrl0</citeref>, VisualPlugin initiated a scheme in late October 2018 to place a significant area of Vyond outside of Vecistani jurisdiction under his mind control. The technique was proven a resounding success following initial tests. Tutu Runner, having been present among a crowd of victims, was able to feign being under VisualPlugin's mind-control. This is because his higher IQ score gave him immunity to the attack. After an office invasion resulted with him being teleported to Turkey, Tutu Runner returned via the same method and engaged in a confrontation with VisualPlugin. This again caused Tutu Runner to be teleported again to an undisclosed headquarters of the PBS Kids Logo. Tutu Runner disguised himself as one a henchmen to avoid being hypnotised by the PBS Kids Logo.
</p>
<p>
	Some days later, Tutu Runner successfully placed under the mind-control of VisualPlugin through an extremely-high-IQ intermediary. Tutu Runner, under the influence, cloned two manifestations of PBS Kids Logo's subservients, Caillou and Boris Anderson<citeref>SseHYEclZOQ</citeref>. The doubles were then used to lead VisualPlugin to an enhanced mind-control formula. The organic victims meanwhile, in being replicated, were transported to a prison cell under VisualPlugin's surveillance with intent to manipulate their minds.
</p>
<p>
	VisualPlugin's hypnotic influence on him was suddenly severed as an effect of Tutu Runner's mental resilience. Anticipating a surprise attack, VisualPlugin sent the Caillou and Boris clones to distract him. Tutu Runner easily overpowered the clones, which the opponent accounted for. However, unexpectedly for VisualPlugin, Tutu Runner immediately left the scene of battle - citing a sudden remembering of VisualPlugin's ability to respawn.
</p>
<h3>Battle of 1st Jaunary 2019</h3>
<p>
	In an effort to assure VisualPlugin's death before the midnight of New Year's 2019, Tutu Runner set up a ruse offering free Rōbux at a public site in Vyond and blackmailled the victims into killing VisualPlugin, else they be frozen in time<citeref>4-YK1jkWX-I</citeref>. Despite the success of his extortion scheme, and Tutu Runner's prior assassinations, VisualPlugin was able to regenerate quickly after.
</p>
<h3>Battle of the 6th Bloxys</h3>
<p>
	A quick skirmish takes place in January 2019, resulting in VisualPlugin being perma-banned (i.e., through an unidentified Rōblox-like admin-command system) from accessing Vecistan's Vyond province<citeref>7_WNm7Bg_NY</citeref>. In following VisualPlugin's 2018 takeover of the <a href="bloxy.html">Bloxy Awards</a>, Tutu Runner set a scheme in motion to fully rewrite <a href="television.html">the over-the-air broadcast</a> and alter the list of winners. The Vecistani flag on the TV broadcast would be replaced with a gold-emboss image of Tutu Runner<citeref>_7w_5y1MMBk</citeref>.
</p>
<p>
	VisualPlugin counteradvanced by hiring mercenaries to engage in a stand off and to forcibly reverse the ban that was previously placed on VisualPlugin. This however was unsuccessful, as Tutu Runner swiftly perma-banned each mercenary. VisualPlugin's decision to wait a few minutes before sending more mercenaries over gave him the advantage of surprise. When a mercenary engaged with Tutu Runner, he was unable to react soon enough before others successfully unbanned VisualPlugin. Then, VisualPlugin rejoined and stuck Tutu Runner with a sword, ending the battle in a decisive victory.
</p>
<h3>Infiltration of the Webhooky Project</h3>
<p>
	<a href="webhooky.html">Webhooky</a> was a long-term message-interception project, running in 2018 and 2019. It was an operation that intercepted chatlogs from hundreds of games on Rōblox, including Arsenal and Boho Salon. Having collected sufficient intel to launch an attack, Tutu Runner built a clone of himself to conceal his identity carry out a sting.
</p>
<p>
	The clone invited VisualPlugin to utilise honeytrapped computing resources with intent to perform mind-control on millions of unsuspecting Rōbloxians<citeref>JXIv_8Vm78c</citeref>. He was able to control tens of Rōbloxians were made to be temporarily under VisualPlugin's influence. That influence was however short-lived, as the Tutu Runner clone hijacked the operation and put VisualPlugin under mind-control.
</p>
<p>
	The mind-control spell was broken on 2019-05-01 after Tutu Runner recognised that the start of that spell was not timestamped properly<citeref>awWsXumIS34</citeref>. VisualPlugin promptly breached into the clone's brain, learning that his recent encounter was with a clone (as opposed to the organic Tutu Runner). Upon learning this, VisualPlugin reciprocated by placing the clone under a similar mind-control spell.
</p>
<h3>Battle of RDC 2019</h3>
<p>
	Tutu Runner and VisualPlugin were planning a July operation at RDC 2019, an invite-only event in the Rōblox metaverse in August of that year<citeref>BwNFjT5picQ</citeref>. Tutu Runner was given an official invitation to the event. However, VisualPlugin soon leant of the news and that he himself was not invited. In response, VisualPlugin created a robot decoy in the image of Tutu Runner to accompany the former and perform mind-control on any unsuspecting attendees. Tutu Runner also has a decoy robot of himself designed as a contingency.
</p>
<p>
	Both parties were able to enter the venue. Although Tutu Runner remained nondescript immediately after entering, VisualPlugin immediately performed mind control on every patron during an event presenation, inclusive of the presenter herself. VisualPlugin was then put under a mind-control trance once they met in a private room, rendering a victory for Tutu Runner.
</p>
<h3>End of the War</h3>
<p>
	The official end to the War of Çıkış was marked by Tutu Runner's withdrawal from conflict in late 2019 after VisualPlugin reportedly gave him a life <em>grounding</em> sentence (i.e., solitary confinement)<citeref>ap3kw6GC-7I</citeref>. After his escape, Tutu Runner chose to cease fighting since he recognised that 'the war would have no end if I kept fighting with VisualPlugin, irrespective of how much of the time I win or lose'. To maintain the narrative that the war was decisively won, Vecistani armed forces are deliberately not investigating the whereabouts of Tutu Runner.
