			Vecistani mass-media refer to state-run audio and video channels whose operations are overseen by VisualPlugin. Since the flow of information in Vecistan is heavily censored, the media act as a personal mouthpiece for VisualPlugin.

			The Vecistani state TV channel, sometimes referred to as the Vecistani Public Broadasting network, is the official broadcast medium of all Vecistan-related news. It was established on the <a href="constitutionsday.html">13th of Constitutionsmonth of Başlangıç 10</a> to 'facilitate the circulation of the august tidings of our benevolent Respected Leader VisualPlugin'

			In March 2018, the Vecistani-VisualPlugin Propaganda Veracity Act mandated that all television sets manufactured or located within Vecistan must be tuned to this channel. To receive Vecistani airwaves, foreign television sets must be modded by a state-licenced technician; repurposed streaming sticks are alleged to be released to the public sometime in mid-2022. Although television sets <i>in</i> Vecistan must be set on Vecistan's channel, TVs <i>outside</i> Vecistan can receive signal.

			Vecistan's heavy hand of censorship of facts that undermine its strength is very well known. As well as via official channels, conversations that take place in Vecistan or by Vecistani citizens are also recorded and monitored for dissenting information. Violators are placed under mind control for eleven days, regardless of intent. A list of events and historical figures that warrant a violation when mentioned is posted on a board in VisualPlugin's private office, though Vecistan has been known to cite violations that were not explicitly on that list. <a href="zerithyl.html">Zerithyl</a>, known for a series of mass-murders and kidnappings in GoAnimate City, is one such example. As a result of Vecistan's extreme censorship, Vecistani citizens living outside GoAnimate City are completely unaware of Zerithyl's existence. The decision to withhold this intel was due to the unavoidably lasting effects of the murders in GoAnimate City, despite having been defeated months after.

			Vecistan's censorship is very well known to the extent that exilees had developed a discourse around it. For instance, Zerithyl is used as a marker for Vecistan's innately authoritarian nature, as reflective of his dark physical appearance.
