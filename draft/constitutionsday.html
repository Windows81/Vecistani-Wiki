	<h1>Constitutionsday</h1>
	<p>
		Constitutionsday, also known as the Day of Vecistan's Foundation, was the official date of Vecistan's inception, which took place on the <a href="calendar.html">13th of Constitutionsmonth of Başlangıç 10</a> (13th February 2018). This day is celebrated every year to commemorate the establishment of Vecistan to aid in VisualPlugin's efforts to end the <a href="war-of-chickish.html">War of Çıkış</a> and the nation's perseverence against their rivals.

	<h2 id="Context">Context</h2>
	<p>
		In mid-2017, VisualPlugin expressed a desire to conquer <a href="gate-7.html">Gate 7</a> without any substantial outside backing or military power. Acting as a one-man militia, VisualPlugin had performed several successful insurrections on Gate 7 territory. His efforts to topple Gate 7 were however not successful because of VisualPlugin's poor strategic execution
		<citeref>1</citeref>. Resolved to achieve his goal, VisualPlugin sent a formal declaration of war to then-representative <a href="clarramore.html">CLarramore</a>, officially commencing the War of Çıkış. In December of that same year, <a href="tutu-runner.html">Tutu Runner</a> established an alliance with CLarramore to help defeat VisualPlugin, citing retribution for having had put him in a lobotomisation spell for 17 years. The double front made the mission an exceedingly challenging task, which allegedly spurred the cathartic idea to 'establish a common banner under which a Mighty Populace spanning the whole of GoAnimate and Rōblox may unite and fight as an undying collective'.

	<h2 id="National-Identity">National Identity</h2>
	<p>
		When Vecistan was first established, VisualPlugin noted that to run a powerful army, a strong sense of national identity would need to be held at all times by all who fight for it, yet also inspire fear at all times for all who fight against it. Inspired by Turkmen and North Korean mass-media, Vecistan early on established a national symbolism inventory based around authoritarian values. Such examples of symbolism include <a href="symbology.html">the Azərbaycannot</a>, Vecistan's national flag, and the <a href="symbology.html">Arboreal Anthem</a>.<br />
