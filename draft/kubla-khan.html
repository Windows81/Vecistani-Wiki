		The Kubla Khan Hotel &amp; Resort<citeref>1</citeref> is a hotel map created by the <a href="Vecistani_Industry_of_Creative_Works">Vecistani Industry of Creative Works</a> that started construction in March 2020. This map is based off architectural plans for the Xanadu<citeref>2</citeref>, a 1970s Las Vegas hotel that was never built.

	<p>
		This map is based off some architectural plans from the 1970s for the Xanadu, a Las Vegas hotel with 'a vaguely Asiatic pleasure-dome theme' that was never built. These plans were digitised under the Dreaming the Skyline collection at UNLV<citeref>3</citeref>. The Xanadu was to be built where the Excalibur Hotel &amp; Casino is located today.

	<p>
		The Kubla Khan currently has 1,483 rooms in 18 storeys. Owing to the hotel's unusual shape, each storey has progressively fewer rooms. The room-numbering scheme follows an <i>XXâ€¢YYY</i> scheme, where <i>XX</i> is the floor number and <i>YYY</i> is for the room, both having leading zeroes. Floors or rooms with a four in any digit are skipped, effectively forming a base-9 numbering system. This is as the number four in Chinese numerology is synonymous with death and misfortune. The lighting in-game has been optimised for the 'Future' technology setting.
	</p>
	<p>
		The final purpose of this game will not be for the player to see <i>every single</i> room, but rather to select one of the room templates that would be inserted in a random location for the player to book for an allotted time. That way, the player will never have millions of blocks in the client at a time - just at most hundreds of thousands. In fact, most hotel games follow the same player-flow model, but to a much smaller and more rudimentary scale. Most of the hotel's components are kept in ServerStorage; whatever 'regions' the client would need are to have rendered during gameplay.
