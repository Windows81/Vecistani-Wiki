	<h1>Vecistani National Symbology</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			Vecistani symbolism is the use of symbols in <a href="vecistani-media.html">Vecistani mass-media</a> to represent certain aspects of the Vecistani national identity and belief system. Prominent symbols include the national flag, musical works produced by
			<a href="music.html">ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL</a>, and artistic cues to Microsoft Windows. When Vecistan was first established, VisualPlugin noted that to run a powerful army, a strong sense of national identity would need to be held at all times by all who fight for it, yet also inspire fear at all times for all who fight against it. Inspired by Turkmen and North Korean mass-media, Vecistan early on established a national symbolism inventory based around authoritarian values.

			The national flag of Vecistan, also called the Azərbaycannot, features three upright seven-pointed stars and a white crescent (a symbol of Islam) arranged in such a way that when rotated 90° anticlockwise, a smiling expression is rendered. The seven-pointed stars represent good fortune, as 7 is a lucky number in Vecistani symbolism. With a 16:9 ratio, the flag consists of a slightly slanted tricolour pattern composed (from left to right) of red, green, and gold - with the crescent and stars on the green partition. Red appears in the base (i.e., the left) because Vecistan was established in spite of the <a href="war-of-chickish.html">War of Çıkış</a>. The green represents Vecistan's cultural basis in Islam, as parts of Vecistan originally occupied the Caspian coastline. The gold colour in the flag is a prominent colour in <a href="otel-veg.html">Otel Vegəşlər</a>, Vecistan's first and most historic tourist site.

			Like other national symbols, Vecistani numerology is heavily influenced by VisualPlugin's example. For instance, the national 'flagship' number is 127.1 and represents intelligence and national supremacy, taking from the standard score (100 SD 15) VisualPlugin had received for a WJ-IV cognitive examination in late 2017. Other notable numbers include 7, 13, 69, 666, and 1337. Each have with their own sentimentalities and connotations in the Vecistani custom. Prime numbers are viewed as atomic symbols in themselves for their infactorability. Primes which are factors of other important numbers are also significant and serve as analogues for their composite counterparts. For instance, 23 is a prime analogue of 69.

			The Arboreal Anthem (also known as the RLVP Anthem<a id="cite-ref-1-0" href="#cite-note-1">[1]</a>), is the official national hymn of Vecistan. It was originally released by <a href="music.html">ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL</a> as a single in tandem with a televised presentation by VisualPlugin in early 2019. Though the original broadcast had not yet been released outside Vecistan, the video that was shown replays daily, and is public on YouTube<a id="cite-ref-1-1" href="#cite-note-1">[1]</a>. The anthem is named for the first line, which is a national motto representing the cedar as a marker of Vecistan's durability.
