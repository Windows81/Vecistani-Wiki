	<h1>Vecistani Census</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			The Vecistani Census is the official census of the Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic that first took place on 20th March 2018 and takes place at the same day each year. Unlike with traditional pooling methods utilised by Earthly Nations, data collection for the Vecistani Census is a fully automated process which does not necessitate any civilian intervention.

		<p>
			The office of the Respected Leader VisualPlugin has the sole discretion to determine how and where the collected data is released. As of the 2022 Census, there had not yet been a census report released for non-Vecistani nationals to access. However, a few leaked statistics were taken from the 2021 Census for Vyond:

		<p>
			Vecistan uses a variety of different technologies, including RF scanners and linear avatar tracking, to determine citizen demographics across different metaverses. Additional measures taken by the Vecistani government are also used to reduce the risk of double-counting - e.g. mandated brain microchipping. The entire census-collection process is only reported to take two hours, though <a href="television.html" title="Vecistani State TV">official media</a> had previously stated the data was 99.99% accurate.
