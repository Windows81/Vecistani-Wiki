		ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL<a id="cite-ref-1" href="#cite-note-1">[1]</a> is the official ministry of music for the Vecistani Great Communal People's Republic, operating also as a copyright-free record label. All musical pieces the label produces is licenced under CC-BY-SA for use both inside and outside of Vecistan. Unlike with <a href="television.html">television broadcasts</a>, which Vecistan demands fewer guidelines as to what the broadcaster should make accessible on the Earthly internet, Vecistani custom ordains Ş.Ç. to release every song that plays on TV onto a gratis music-sharing platform (i.e., SoundCloud<a id="cite-ref-2" href="#cite-note-2">[2]</a>) within 11 days after it first airs.

	<p>
		ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL was a pronouncible non-word chosen for its inclusion of every letter that is made distinguishable in Azerbaijani but not in non-Turkic scripts (i.e., I, İ, Ə, X, Q, Ç, Ş, Ö, and Ü) within the name.

		ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL airs new singles on a near-daily basis. Each track is generally given a unique name, usually consisting of a haphazard combination of Unicode characters and symbols. A select photo of VisualPlugin from the Vecistani media archive is used as the cover image for that respective SoundCloud release. Unlike the name, which often appears once a song starts airing, the choice of cover image is not otherwise associated with Vecistani media. These singles are then collected into an album of 20-30 songs each. The album name and song order are then discussed at a televised board meeting, with final approval from VisualPlugin. Once the album is released,

		Most of ŞOXI ÇÜMÖĞİQƏL's singles are instrumentals, encompassing a large variety of genres - such as orchestral, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-986295117/make-the-choqqelzlikht-sry?in=aaaroh-abo-shadi/sets/long-time-no-shulqrriqpskhishee">dubstep</a>,
		<a href="https://soundcloud.com/shooky-chuchu-moghikill-7/grjk-uxxistpi?in=aaaroh-abo-shadi/sets/erm-block">trap</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shooky-chuchu-moghikill-7/gggfg">atmospheric</a>. On 6th January 2022, it was revealed in external media that the ministry's DAW of choice is FL Studio<a id="cite-ref-3" href="#cite-note-3">[3]</a>.

	<h3 id="Odd-Time-Signatures">Odd Time Signatures</h3>
	<p>
		Starting with the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aaaroh-abo-shadi/sets/the-visualpluginavirus">Visualpluginavirus</a> album, Vecistan enacted a law requiring all songs released under the label, with few exceptions, to be composed at least partially in a time signature not in 4/4 (i.e., common time). The law also stipulates that any tracks not in line with the policy will be modified without notification to the original composer by the Office of Supreme Repsected Leader VisualPlugin to reach compliance.

	<h3 id="Xenharmony">Xenharmony</h3>
	<p>
		On 17th September 2021, VisualPlugin announced a radical shift of the composition style the label must adhere to, owing to a breakthrough in xenharmonic technology<a id="cite-ref-4" href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a>. All songs produced from 19th September 2021 are required to be composed a microtonal scale of any form (i.e., just, N-edo, etc.) This rule does not apply to tracks which already have a microtonal version. For example, GΠ☂☂, originally composed by stacking 3:4:5 harmonies over 50, 60, and 69 Hz and using the union as the scale, was remapped to 12-edo in a MIDI rendition<a id="cite-ref-5" href="#cite-note-5">[5]</a><a id="cite-ref-6" href="#cite-note-6">[6]</a>. The ministry's first non-diatonic single, Just Intonated JIst<a id="cite-ref-7" href="#cite-note-7">[7]</a>, was broadcast on Vecistani airwaves, having been released on SoundCloud immediately after the airing.

	<h3 id="Employment">Employment</h3>
	<p>
		Ş.Ç. claims to consist of artists of different backgrounds from around the nation. As with most of Vecistan's ministries, it has been reported that due to the lack of employment-training pathways in Vecistan, as well as heavy censorship in the country, VisualPlugin would act as the sole employee at the ministry, acting as the author of every song released thereby. This is caused in large part by the severely underqualified pool of domestic candidates that would apply to work for the label as a result.
	</p>
	<h3 id="Monopolistic-Practices">Monopolistic Practices</h3>
	<p>
		Vecistani law prohibits the distribution or playback of music produced outside the label, unless there is specific intent to complement a foreign property that song is associated with (e.g., distributing copies of the Adopt Me soundtrack in a context where that game is being discussed). However, Vecistan has been known to discard the latter clause and arrest citizens on baseless accusations of illegal playback, causing citizens to opt to only ever reproduce songs approved by Ş.Ç. Fear of retribution, combined with the relative ease with which the label's works could be collected, ensures a complete monopoly over all music that is listened to in Vecistan.
