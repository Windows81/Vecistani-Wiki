			The Vecistani Industry of Creative Works is a ministry that specialises in the development of state-designed maps for use in the <a href="roblox.html" title="Rōblox Province">Rōblox province</a>. Such maps include the <a href="kubla-khan.html" title="The Kubla Khan">Kubla Khan</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/2960624866">Septicentricity</a>, <a href="http://roblox.com/games/2607258385">Greenwater</a>, and the epynomous <a target="_blank" href="http://roblox.com/games/1189083537">Otel Vegəşlər</a>.

			As with most of Vecistan's ministries, it has been reported that due to the lack of employment-training pathways in Vecistan, as well as heavy censorship of information in the country, VisualPlugin would act as the sole engineer at the ministry. This is caused in large part by the severely underqualified pool of domestic candidates that would apply to work for the label as a result, as well as the high entry-level requirements on their job applications. All job positions at the ministry are stated require that Vecistani citizens have had joined Rōblox before 1997, which is impossible to fulfil. VisualPlugin allegedly stated that having set the application threshold intentionally high protects his status of authority in the case any one builder were to get in a power struggle with him.

			One of the ministry's most recurrent claims is that their works are immensely popular, even to the extent of having won multiple Bloxy awards. Though official visit counts for the ministry's maps have not been released, unofficial estimates place Otel Vegəşlər, Greenwater, and Kubla Khan at 5×12<sup>3</sup>, 7×12<sup>1</sup> and 6×12<sup>1</sup> monthly foreign visitors respectively, with all others trailing far behind. In contrast, Niagara Falls near the US/Canada border boasts an average of 10×12<sup>5</sup> monthly visits, and Rōblox game Adopt Me has a total visitor count of 4×12<sup>9</sup>.
