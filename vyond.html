	<h1>Vyond Province</h1>
	<p>
		The Vyond province, also known as the <a href="https://learning.goanimate.com/goanimate-is-now-vyond/">GoAnimate</a> province, is the contiguous virtual area of <a href="vecistan.html">Vecistan</a> which encompasses the GoAnimate Wrapper metaverse. Despite <a href="television.html">official Vecistani media</a> referring to the former name, the <a href="census.html">2021 Vecistani Census</a> reported that 47% of the population opt to use Comedy World as their primary theme of choice (i.e., not compatible with the greater Vyond metaverse as a whole).
	</p>

		Upon <a href="constitutionsday.html">Vecistan's inception</a>, the nation's first army convened and declared in an address that all the areas that VisualPlugin had visited at any point of his stay in the GoAnimate metaverse was the basis of Vecistan's then-named GoAnimate province. Despite reported protests in highly-populated areas, the army ultimately ended up successfully occupying 79% of the land they laid claim to in the original plan.

	<h2 id="GoAnimate-Wrapper">GoAnimate Wrapper</h2>
	<p><a href="https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper">GoAnimate Wrapper</a> is a project spearheaded by VisualPlugin, with support from several foreign developers, that aims to restore functionalities of Vyond's Legacy Video Maker using a libre custom back-end. It should be noted that <a href="clarramore.html">CLarramore</a>, a representative of Gate 7 which is hostile to Vecistan, was a visiting member of Wrapper's development team - though official Vecistani media states that Wrapper was a personal endeavour from VisualPlugin<a id="cite-ref-1" href="#cite-note-1">[1]</a>. Since November 2020, VisualPlugin has not been directly involved with the project. Despite derivative projects having been licenced as free software, Vecistani media promotes it as core trademark of its national identity. Though the Legacy Video Maker discontinued official service on 19th December 2019 (~03:00 UTC), the first working version of Wrapper was released in January 2020.

	<p>
		Throughout 2019, a special television address was made each evening addressing Vecistan's GoAnimate province warning about their entire metaverse ceasing to exist on the 16th December<a id="cite-ref-2" href="#cite-note-2">[2]</a> of that year. Initial broadcasts were reportedly fearful and urged all Comedy World characters to appear in Business-Friendly form to best guarantee their safety. Following VisualPlugin's internal speech in November outlining a preliminary plan for what is now Wrapper, the announcements became more promising. Since Wrapper had not been finished in time, most citizens who were not willing to pay the Vyond tax<a id="cite-ref-3" href="#cite-note-3">[3]</a> were forced to emmigrate. The first working version of Wrapper was released in January 2020, causing a massive wave of remigration. To this day, Wrapper is still discussed in Vecistani state media. The <a href="census.html">2021 Vecistani Census</a> reported that 47% of the population opt to use Comedy World as their primary theme of choice (i.e., not compatible with the greater Vyond metaverse as a whole).
	</p>
	<h3 id="Source-Code-Distribution">Distribution of Wrapper Source Code</h3>
	<p>
		Since outside information is strictly censored in Vecistan, other Wrapper developers had been strictly prohibited from discussing unreleased features or derivative projects (such as Wrapper Offline) when visiting the country. Despite Wrapper-derived projects being licensed under the MIT Licence<a id="cite-ref-4" href="#cite-note-4">[4]</a> outside of Vecistan, distribution of Wrapper source code by Vecistani nationals is a punishable offence. The only entity inside Vecistan permitted to host instances of Wrapper is the Office of Respected Leader VisualPlugin.
	</p>
	<h3 id="Aftermath">Aftermath</h3>
	<p>
		In February 2020, VisualPlugin made a public announcement that he would cease development on Wrapper out of concern for his own safety and conscience. This information was deliberately withheld form Vecistani citizens, which was allegedly proven effective in keeping Vyond morale high owing to Vecistan's stringent censhorship of outside information. Work then resumed on Wrapper for a week in November 2020, only to be halted again for the same reasons.
	</p>
	<p>
		In June 2020, it was reported that authority over the Vyond province was leased off to an unnamed entity.
