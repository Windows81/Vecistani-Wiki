	<h1>Animaker Province</h1>
	<div>
		<p>
			The Animaker province is a contiguous area of land within the <a href="https://www.animaker.com">Animaker</a> metaverse acquired by Vecistan on 24th June 2021. The Animaker province has been advertised in <a href="television.html" title="Vecistani State TV">Vecistani media</a> as a 'monument to the unquestionable victory against high-handed and authoritarian forces that limited the freedom of expression of its populace'.

			Vecistan promotes their newly occupied territory <a href="https://youtu.be/eukkZ-5RRGk?t=337">as a haven of freedom for aspiring animators</a>. Prior to the acquisition, <a href="https://app.animaker.com/pricing">non-paying</a> citizens were reportedly unable to utilise custom fonts or add child-form characters to their animation, and were repeated extorted into paying Animaker to have permission to do so. In spite of those restictions, pre-Vecistani academic surveys of the Animaker lands compared them to a desert in that both were devoid of life.

			VisualPlugin first planned to occupy Animaker on 23rd June 2021, one day prior to the surprise <a href="https://youtu.be/eukkZ-5RRGk">declaration of completion</a>, owing to a lack of conscience to continue working on the <a href="wrapper.html" class="mw-redirect.html" title="GoAnimate Wrapper">Wrapper</a> project. The mission was reported to have taken a relatively short time to accomplish owing to VisualPlugin's prior experience in the web-design stack. The entire procedure of entry to the Vecistani province, according to internal documents, involves nothing more than access to Animaker, the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-modify-headers/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa">Requestly</a> browser extension installed onto that browser, and the appropriate scripts to execute.
